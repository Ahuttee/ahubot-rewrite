My
verdict:
Youre
all
stupid
and
senseless

Also
since
this
is
suppposed
to
be
anime-related
the
anime
is
bad.

Cats
do
not

they

Its

get
the
attention
of
a
human

cats

We
arent

except
instead
of

we
have

We

The
Japanese
can
be
considered
the
originators

Lets
be
honest
the
others
are
all
copycats.
Even
most
of
the

themselves
are
copied.
But
who
cares
right?
You
guys
will

As
Frederica
declared
the
departure
to
the
Sanctuary
was
two
days
later.
While
working
in
a
mansion
Frederica
teaches
Patrasche
where
to
go
to
the
sanctuary
at
the
stables.
Shes
still
responsible
for
most
of
the
mansion
work
so
<@203488399061942272>
even
suggested
to
teach
her
where
to
find
thesanctuary
in
an
effort
to
save
some
time.
Im
sorry
but
the
location
of
the
sanctuary
is
too
big
for
my
husband.
I
cant
tell
you
with
light
momentum
let
alone
the
servant
I
am.
However
it
is
something
that
I
would
like
to
avoid
originally.
Then
it
was
gently
declined.
Although
I
felt
that
I
couldnt
feel
it
I
couldnt
reach
the
sanctuary
even
if
I
complained
to
Roswar
about
the
caution.
As
far
as
the
future
goes
theres
no
way
I
can
do
it
for
<@203488399061942272>
except
for
Fredericas
opinion.
Therefore
<@203488399061942272>
spent
two
unfriendly
days
in
Alam
village
interacting
with
the
villagers
and
returning
to
his
position
as
a
servant
to
do
housework
chores.
Similarly
Emilia
who
has
no
hands
has
sharp
lips
on
a
pack
that
does
not
come
out
but
she
is
surprised
to
accompany
<@203488399061942272>
who
descends
into
the
village
and
makes
an
effort
to
bridge
the
distance
with
the
villagers
and
documents
of
the
kind
that
<@203488399061942272>
does
not
understand.
I
spent
my
time
accumulating
knowledge
by
looking
at
the
literature.
So
during
each
of
these
two
days
some
changes
have
taken
place.
For
example
one
of
them
is
Ah!
Why
isnt
it
cluttering
up
like
this
already?
I
dont
want
to
sort
out
the
materials
that
I
have
to
keep
the
materials
that
I
just
need
to
read
and
the
materials
that
are
not
worth
reading.
just
like
this……!
While
scratching
his
head
and
hanging
down
his
complaints
Otto
is
compiling
the
materials
at
hand
at
a
tremendous
speed.
When
I
glance
at
the
papers
and
grasp
the
rough
contents
I
throw
them
into
a
large
mountain
on
the
desk
and
the
next
material
The
same
selection
as
the
next
material
is
repeated.
While
watching
Ottos
fast-moving
eye
movements
hand
movements
and
head
rotations
at
a
pace
that
seems
to
give
fire
<@203488399061942272>s
face-to-face
cheeks
admired
Wow
thats
amazing.
Even
if
I
look
at
the
prints
lined
up
I
write
about
what
Im
talking
about.
I
havent
even
touched
on
the
content.
Im
just
trying
to
streamline
things
that
can
be
done
purely
for
books
for
petition
and
so
on.
I
wish
I
had
done
so
when
I
received
the
documents...
No
but
this
arrangement
would
probably
be
a
rule
that
only
the
person
who
handles
it
would
understand.
The
subtle
impression
of
<@203488399061942272>
Otto
with
a
tired
face
while
looking
at
the
mountain
of
materials.
If
you
think
of
the
owner
of
the
material
in
his
words-Roswars
face
the
theory
that
Otto
lamented
and
exhaled
seems
to
be
the
most
relevant.
It
was
a
horrible
thing
to
do
with
Roswar
so
these
materials
were
organized
in
his
own
way.
The
problem
is
that
it
contributes
to
inefficiencies
that
others
do
not
understand
and
in
the
absence
of
a
responsible
person
there
is
nothing
else
to
do
but
to
start
over.
Okay
Ive
finished
dividing
roughly.
After
that
rearrange
them
in
chronological
order.
Before
that
it
may
be
subdivided
once
waiting
for
processing
and
processing
...
Otto
is
definitely
an
A-type
whether
its
a
facebook
or
nervous.
What
is
that
agata?
It
doesnt
sound
very
good.
<@203488399061942272>
refuses
to
explain
to
Otto
who
is
looking
at
him
with
his
own
eyes
waving
silently.
I
dont
believe
in
blood
group
personality
diagnosis
but
it
is
reasonably
effective
as
a
story.
By
the
way
<@203488399061942272>
is
a
type
B
family
rather
than
the
Natsuki
family.
I
dont
feel
so
good
because
Im
told
everyone
even
if
I
talk
to
anyone.
I
thought
right
now.
What
the
hell
is
it?
Its
a
good
pace
so
lets
just
go.
Im
a
good
effi-
cient
person
but
isnt
this
situation
strange
in
the
first
place?
Why
is
I
a
peddler
sweating
hard
on
the
forehead
in
the
office
of
the
frontier
and
working
hard
Are
you
organizing
it?
Is
your
position
wrong?
Its
late
to
notice
right?
Otto
now
aware
of
the
facts
<@203488399061942272>
leans
his
head
and
laughs
mercifully.
Otto
is
thus
involved
in
miscellaneous
affairs
—
not
to
mention
the
mansion
of
his
work
as
a
frontier
county
but
the
background
to
his
work
being
organized.
In
other
words
it
is
the
securing
of
Emilia
personnel
in
the
Roswar
camp.
At
present
from
a
<@203488399061942272>
perspective
Emilias
position
in
the
election
is
not
very
good.
<@203488399061942272>
who
is
recognized
by
the
people
concerned
as
her
knight
has
done
some
good
and
has
made
the
achievement
of
repelling
witches
and
subduing
the
white
whale
but
how
effective
is
it
compared
to
the
bad
environment
surrounding
her?
Is
doubtful.
Emilia
has
already
receded
from
the
starting
point
compared
to
each
camp.
The
more
difficult
part
of
her
position
is
the
invisibleness
of
the
backing
Roswar.
Despite
being
in
a
position
to
support
her
openly
Roswars
conduct
to
date
is
the
first
failing
word
for
a
supporter.
It
was
supposed
that
it
would
happen
but
there
was
no
appropriate
countermeasure
against
the
witchcraft
and
this
situation
that
we
can
not
contact
even
now
even
after
overcoming
those
damages.
Hes
no
longer
a
nuisance
at
the
level
he
wants
to
be
clear
whether
hes
an
enemy
or
an
ally.
The
habit
Roswar
officials
often
do
not
know
what
he
is
doing
or
hesitate
to
say
anything.
Not
only
Roswar
supreme
lamb
but
also
Frederica
who
has
a
high
work
consciousness
as
a
waiter
he
keeps
quiet
against
both
<@203488399061942272>
and
Emilia
when
it
comes
to
Puck
and
Beatrice.
In
other
words
there
is
no
one
in
Emilia
who
can
talk
with
peace
of
mind.
Of
course
<@203488399061942272>
wants
and
wants
to
be
that
for
her
but
<@203488399061942272>s
reach
is
a
bit
shorter
than
the
average
person.
For
<@203488399061942272>
who
unfortunately
realizes
that
he
is
a
man
who
cant
reach
the
itch
its
a
rushing
word
that
cannot
completely
eliminate
Emilias
anxiety.
So
<@203488399061942272>
thought
about
it
and
went
back
and
forth
between
Aram
village
and
the
mansion
and
enjoyed
the
meal
and
the
tea
after
the
meal
``Oh
it
is
human
beings
to
sit
down
without
a
purpose
in
one
place
like
this
right?
It
was
Otto
with
a
relaxed
smile.
That
is
if
there
is
no
ally
around
you
you
should
grow
it
later.
I
felt
like
I
was
making
a
disturbing
statement
but
that
doesnt
matter
to
me
right?
I
dont
think
so.
Ah
Mr.
Otto.
I
havent
summarized
the
documents
around
here
yet.
Ah
sorry.
Well
this
is
the
only
amount
of
magical
ore
mining
mine
and
its
stockpile...
Isnt
this
a
document
completely
prohibited
from
being
viewed
by
outsiders?
Ah
did
you
see
it?
Did
you
see
it
a
little?
Ah
yes.
Yes
well
Ill
tell
Roswar
from
me
dont
worry.
Its
amazing
that
there
is
no
room
to
feel
relieved
at
all!
Otto
makes
a
noise
while
keeping
the
handed
documents
away
from
his
eyes
and
<@203488399061942272>
does
not
lose
sight
of
the
bystander
with
a
grinning
face.
Otto
shook
his
lips
with
a
face
that
was
shocked
at
<@203488399061942272>’s
attitude
No
way
without
serious
protection
youre
not
trying
to
show
off
the
materials
that
outsiders
shouldnt
see
so
youre
going
to
step
down
on
the
price
of
the
negotiations
and
everything.
I
dont
mean.
Im
fully
planning
on
paying
for
all
your
shipments
and
all
the
conditions
of
your
request.
Im
thinking
that
Ill
pull
you
to
a
deeper
position
where
you
cant
escape.
Tesa
Extraordinarily
bad
quality!
Why
do
you
try
to
carry
such
a
burden
on
such
a
fledgling
peddler
again?
Stop
it!
Otto
protests
with
a
fearful
look.
Upon
hearing
this
<@203488399061942272>
patted
his
head
lightly
as
if
he
was
overloaded
and
once
he
erased
his
expression
he
muttered
Bad.
I
felt
a
little
impatient
and
ahead.
The
situation
was
so
crowded
that
there
was
no
sign
that
the
entangled
threads
would
come
loose
and
I
was
impatient.
I
didnt
hear
about
your
circumstances
and
it
was
bad.
Ah
no
Im
worried
that
Ill
be
so
calm
suddenly...Is
that
okay
to
ask?
Why
do
you
expect
me
so
much?
Otto
feels
embarrassed
by
<@203488399061942272>
who
suddenly
reaches
the
talking
table
normally
but
he
accepts
it
and
raises
questions.
From
his
point
of
view
his
relationship
with
<@203488399061942272>
was
short
and
not
reliable
enough.
Of
course
even
with
<@203488399061942272>
his
relationship
with
him
is
neither
strong
nor
long.
Hes
been
in
contact
with
him
several
times
in
the
last
loop
but
hes
more
impressed
with
him
than
his
current
Otto.
So
why
is
<@203488399061942272>
so
attached
to
Otto?
Suddenly
theres
no
reason
Im
obsessed
with
you.
I
dont
appreciate
your
individuality
and
because
the
conditions
are
so
contradictory
its
a
big
factor
to
call
out.
Its
frank.
-I
understand
but
is
it
a
condition?
In
a
royal
election
relationship
it
is
a
faction
that
no
ones
breathing.
It
is
sensitive
to
profits
and
losses
and
it
is
easy
to
see
that
it
is
easy
to
negotiate
and
pull
in
to
an
ally.
And
above
all
it
is
discriminative
for
the
half-elf
Emilia.
I
dont
see
it
with
my
own
eyes.
「――――」
Hearing
<@203488399061942272>s
three
conditions
Otto
is
silently
looking
at
us.
Both
conditions
are
conditions
that
cannot
be
neglected
considering
the
current
circumstances
surrounding
<@203488399061942272>.
And
<@203488399061942272>
judged
that
the
person
called
Otto
Swen
who
met
so
far
had
cleared
those
minimum
conditions.
Otto
remains
silent
waiting
for
<@203488399061942272>s
reaction.
Its
eyes
were
different
from
those
when
it
was
hitting
each
other
with
a
light
mouth
and
it
was
swaying
as
if
to
guess
the
inside
of
it
by
shining
a
calm
glow.
I
realize
that
they
are
being
priced.
I
didnt
hide
it.
It
was
natural
for
me
to
do
that
because
I
took
the
first
step
there.
In
addition
its
just
my
look.
--lets
listen
I
felt
like
I
could
do
well
with
you.
Honestly
its
okay
to
have
more
Emilia-tan
allies
but
its
even
better
if
the
other
horse
matches
me.
Oh
and
Emilia-tan.
Dont
have
any
opposite
favors.
If
that
happens
Ill
have
to
slash
even
if
youre
my
stilts
friend...!
Is
it
just
a
romance
target
to
be
destroyed?
If
you
have
a
rival
you
dont
want
to
win!
Dont
you
lick
my
lack
of
confidence
in
yourself?
Until
now
there
was
only
one
hand
who
affirmed
me.
The
breakdown
is
parents
Rem
Wilhelm
Emilia
and
conditions
such
as
Julius
and
Reinhardt.
With
that
in
mind
it
seems
that
one
hand
is
too
much
before
I
know
it.
Is
it
possible
to
think
that
being
in
a
different
world
and
receiving
such
a
reputation
is
a
good
step
in
my
own
way?
Something
doesnt
seem
visibly
changed.
Anyway
Hey
youre
a
person
who
doesnt
hide
your
mind
to
the
freshest
part.
Its
a
good
duck
at
the
bargaining
table
where
you
dont
have
to
deal
with
a
traders
stomach.
If
this
seat
was
a
negotiating
seat
I
would
have
hustled
a
little
but
Im
not
here
with
a
merchant
and
a
duck
but
with
me?
If
you
were
in
that
position
swap
your
gear
and
attitude.
but
Dont
you
say
that
when
you
evaluate
your
part
as
a
merchant?
What
exactly
does
this
mean
before
your
tongue
is
dry?
Otto
sighs
with
a
troubled
face
but
with
the
expression
of
the
tense
caution
that
he
had
just
mentioned.
He
snatched
one
eye
on
the
subtle
<@203488399061942272>
I
would
like
to
talk
about
this
kind
of
thing
here
Natsuki-san.
My
purpose
is
not
too
big
for
me
to
tell
people
but
I
have
dreams.
I
think
theres
only
two
choices:
a
mans
dream
is
so
stupid
that
its
silly
and
its
stupid
enough
to
keep
it
in
my
chest.
Can
you
tell
me?
I
dont
like
to
agree.
Im
the
second
son
of
a
decent
merchant.
I
grew
up
wealthy
when
I
was
little
but
when
I
think
about
self-reliance
especially
from
home.
In
a
position
where
nothing
can
be
done
I
dont
know
how
similar
it
is
to
the
brotherhood
in
<@203488399061942272>s
original
world
but
basically
in
this
world
too
the
family
business
and
aristocrats
are
inherited--the
system
in
which
the
eldest
son
succeeds
is
also
common.
Apparently.
Then
like
<@203488399061942272>s
image
of
medieval
fantasy
Ottos
role
as
a
second
son
requires
the
assistant
or
independence
of
the
eldest
son
who
succeeds
the
house.
I
helped
my
brothers
management
while
learning
the
basics
of
commerce
and
became
independent
when
I
made
some
money
on
my
own.
I
bought
the
earth
dragon
full
fu
and
dragon
car
at
the
stake
and...
well
I
was
born.
There
was
also
Kago
so
I
think
it
was
all
right.
Its
a
blessing
of
Kototsutsu
and
Kotorei.
If
there
is
a
blessing
that
you
can
talk
to
various
animals
it
seems
that
you
can
make
a
profit
depending
on
how
you
use
it.
Its
not
as
convenient
as
it
sounds
but
I
think
there
are
more
troublesome
problems
than
Natsuki-san
imagines.
Anyway
Ive
been
working
hard
for
a
few
years
but
in
the
meantime
a
dream
that
has
sprung
up
There
is
something.
Continuing
from
the
story
of
independence
Otto
brings
up
the
word
dream
that
I
touched
on
earlier.
For
that
reason
<@203488399061942272>
is
in
a
position
to
listen
to
his
residence
properly
for
no
particular
reason.
In
response
Otto
laughed
in
a
favorable
manner
and
said
Its
a
common
story.
Everyone
who
wants
to
be
a
peddler
wants
to
dream.-I
want
to
have
a
shop
that
is
my
own
castle
and
stay
there
while
continuing
to
do
business.
If
I
could
do
that
in
a
big
city
It
would
be
the
greatest
pleasure
as
a
merchant.
Is
it
Ottos
dream?
Its
a
boring
wish.
Its
about
turning
around
and
reaching
the
same
place
where
you
want
to
be
where
you
were
born
and
raised.
Thats
what
it
is.
Otto
scratches
his
cheeks
with
his
fingers
in
a
shy
sensation
and
speaks
fast
to
hide
his
embarrassment.
Convinced
by
his
answer
<@203488399061942272>
however
carefully
examines
whether
he
can
get
a
good
answer
and
heighs
heavily
on
the
chair.
However
because
of
<@203488399061942272>s
worries
Otto
succeeded
by
saying
I
cant
overlook
the
chance
that
a
samurai
can
sell
to
big
guys
as
a
second
son
of
a
merchant
or
a
future
big
merchant
as
a
peddler.
Lets
say
that
the
future
of
the
favor
is
the
king
of
the
future.
Isnt
it
a
business
opportunity
that
is
too
big
to
come
back
to
life
even
if
I
try
again?
Okay
then
Id
appreciate
it
if
you
could
help.
Thank
you
Im
glad.
I
thought
you
would
say
that
Otto.
Keep
organizing
the
materials.
That?!
I
said
something
good
now
isnt
the
reaction
too
thin?
If
I
am
impressed
with
something
and
answer
it
I
feel
like
Im
losing...
Well
in
any
case
when
an
outsider
sees
the
material
I
cant
let
it
go
without
doing
anything.
Okke
This
person
is
so
terrible
to
go
around
once!
The
end
points
of
the
lengthy
exchange
did
not
change
and
Otto
was
not
rewarded
for
his
new
determination.
Despite
having
such
an
otto
<@203488399061942272>
cannot
help
but
be
grateful
to
him.
I
will
never
put
it
in
my
mouth.
Ill
tell
you
Im
not
the
same
as
Natsuki-san
who
is
an
unconditional
friend
of
Emilia.
Currently
Im
only
dealing
with
conditions.
Temporary
quarrel
between
the
frontier
and
Emilia.
Whatever
happens
at
that
time
I
will
choose
the
side
with
the
profitable
account
at
that
time.
Do
not
misunderstand
that
it
is
a
perfect
ally.
Thus
its
enough
for
you
to
put
Emilia-tan
and
Roswar
on
the
balance
and
get
lost.
Youre
my
palm.
Please
be
assured
that
you
will
carefully
teach
you
the
goodness
of
Emilia-tan.
-Did
you
listen
to
the
story
right
now?
Rejecting
Otto
as
an
excuse
he
makes
a
point
in
a
different
direction
from
him
at
the
end
of
his
words.
Ottos
face
was
terribly
annoyed
by
<@203488399061942272>s
actions
and
he
turned
his
eyes
to
the
direction
of
<@203488399061942272>s
line
of
sight.
there
Yeah...
not
yes.
I
have
heard
carefully
Mr.
<@203488399061942272>.
Said
a
girl
in
a
wait-and-see
smile
smiling
with
an
adorable
face
and
shaking
her
brown
hair.
This
is
the
second
change
in
the
mansion
over
the
last
two
days.
Frederica
who
realized
that
it
was
physically
impossible
to
maintain
the
mansion
by
himself
with
the
help
of
<@203488399061942272>
but
the
servants
ability
is
half
full
and
his
physical
condition
has
not
recovered
It
was
she-Petra
Leyte
who
jumped
all
the
way
up
to
the
village
where
she
descended
to
Alam
village
and
was
looking
for
a
collaborator.
She
was
also
a
refugee
from
the
city
of
Alam
and
she
was
a
refugee
from
the
royal
capital.
She
had
returned
to
the
village
safely
and
was
supposed
to
have
had
an
uneasy
time
in
a
village
where
more
than
half
of
the
villagers
did
not
return.
However
he
immediately
caught
up
with
the
news
of
recruitment
of
new
maids
in
Fredericas
mansion
and
since
he
was
motivated
and
there
were
no
other
candidates
he
is
entering
the
mansion
as
temporary
employment
for
the
time
being.
Its
still
small
but
its
great
to
be
a
maid
away
from
her
parents
Petra.
Im
12
years
old
so
Im
a
good
adult
who
can
work...
not
an
adult.
Please
treat
<@203488399061942272>-sama
as
an
adult.
I
will
treat
you
as
a
honorific
and
I
will
give
you
a
license
from
Frederica
and
I
will
think
about
it
if
I
can
get
a
temporary
maid.
Until
then
you
will
be
treated
cutely
by
me
forever.
When
I
stroking
the
head
of
a
moving
girl
roughly
the
girl
whose
trimmed
hair
is
disturbed
clings
to
her
while
saying
Kyaa.
Somehow
its
a
reaction
that
is
different
from
my
imagination
but
it
is
a
much
better
reaction
than
being
abused
and
spit.
Anyway
although
I
was
about
to
grow
tall
Petras
suitability
as
a
maid
who
has
a
surprisingly
strong
sex
root
and
is
raised
is
quite
high.
Although
there
are
still
many
things
that
can
not
be
reached
it
may
be
judged
that
it
is
already
above
<@203488399061942272>
including
Fredericas
follow-up
regarding
cleaning
and
preparation
of
meals.
<@203488399061942272>
seriously
useless.
She
was
listening
to
the
inside
conversation
from
outside
the
office
door.
Of
course
it
is
<@203488399061942272>s
instruction
and
it
is
a
step
to
block
the
escape
route
by
inviting
Ottos
careless
remarks.
Otto
who
noticed
it
turned
his
face
red
and
stared
at
<@203488399061942272>
Was
planned?!?
Its
not
such
a
worrying
thing
because
the
third
person
came
in
and
your
statement
was
recorded
as
an
official
one
both
in
name
and
reality.
Im
tearful
to
secure
the
jurys
heart.
Work...
Think
like
that.
I
wonder
what
humans
are
saying
about
crafts?
Otto
holding
his
head
and
realizing
that
the
escape
route
had
finally
disappeared
yelled
at
half
cry
but
it
was
already
late.
He
smiled
at
Otto
and
<@203488399061942272>
thumbs
up
at
Petra
at
the
door
and
thumbs
up.
I
did
a
good
job
Petra.
But
wouldnt
Frederica
get
angry
after
spending
time
like
this?
This
time
is
when
I
am
cleaning
the
corridor.
Even
if
I
spend
more
time
than
usual
cleaning
the
corridor
in
front
of
the
lords
room
I
will
not
get
angry.
Im
disappointed.
A
girl
is
a
woman
even
if
shes
small...
Receiving
only
the
last
words
of
<@203488399061942272>s
deeply
moved
words
Petra
gladly
relaxes
his
cheeks.
It
was
also
true
that
her
unchanging
reaction
and
attitude
had
a
part
to
be
saved.
Petra
like
Otto
is
a
collaborator
who
is
not
under
the
influence
of
Roswar.
Compared
to
Otto
Petra
can
do
less
for
Emilia
as
a
supporter
and
her
presence
may
be
less
influential
than
<@203488399061942272>.
But
she
is
not
afraid
of
Emilia.
<@203488399061942272>
does
not
forget
that
she
approached
Emilia
head-on
as
she
evacuated
to
the
royal
capital.
Surely
its
the
same
for
Emilia.
There
must
be
a
chance
that
Emilia
will
be
saved
by
her
existence
alone.
Its
good
to
have
a
lot
of
friends.
It
doesnt
matter
what
you
can
do.
What
you
want
to
do
for
that
person
and
what
you
will
be
able
to
do
is
important.
Well
in
the
first
place
if
I
talk
about
the
number
of
things
I
can
do
Ill
be
terrible.
<@203488399061942272>
is
also
aware
that
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
the
disadvantages
if
you
count
the
fingers
are
aware.
Still
I
want
to
be
on
her
side
so
I
have
no
choice
but
to
do
something
that
I
havent
made
use
of.
Its
a
comfortable
calculation
that
you
cant
deny
if
it
is
said
that
it
has
reopened.
Its
still
very
small
but
lets
do
our
best
from
here.
This
is
our
early
Emilia
member.
<@203488399061942272>
makes
a
declaration
by
making
a
clenched
fist
and
sticking
it
out.
Receiving
it
Otto
and
Petra
who
lay
down
and
put
their
eyes
on
each
other
I
didnt
say
a
word
to
join
that
faction.
Dont
get
me
wrong?
I
want
to
be
on
your
side
but
I
dont
want
to
lose
to
my
sister
in
an
important
place...
Otto
scratched
his
head
and
looked
amazed.
Petra
crosses
her
hands
behind
her
back
murmuring
with
her
face
down.
Well
even
so
at
the
end
they
were
dating
me
with
my
fists
and
there
was
no
doubt
about
their
goodness.

-Thus
the
two
days
leading
up
to
the
sanctuary
were
only
a
slight
step
forward
but
the
time
had
passed
while
making
<@203488399061942272>
feel
certain
things.
I
cannot
accompany
you
but
please
be
careful
along
the
way.
Please
tell
my
husband
that
Frederica
is
protecting
the
mansion.
On
the
morning
of
departure
when
I
put
a
dragon
car
in
front
of
the
main
gate
of
the
mansion
Frederica
who
had
come
out
to
see
him
off
broke
his
hips.
Her
bowing
with
a
good
attitude
is
beautifully
regulated
and
there
is
a
sense
of
intimidation
that
the
side
to
be
directed
naturally
straightens
the
spine.
Anyway
<@203488399061942272>
and
Emilia
who
received
it
faced
each
other
Im
sorry
that
its
a
busy
time.
I
dont
have
Roswar
and
I
think
Id
have
to
be
the
lord
on
my
behalf...
In
any
case
its
hard
for
me
and
Emilia
to
work
around
that.
Even
though
I
can
handle
miscellaneous
duties
the
numerical
relations
are
exposed
outside
the
circle.
<@203488399061942272>
smiles
at
the
unresponsiveness
thinking
of
the
results
of
these
two
days.
As
a
result
of
Otto
wandering
around
in
a
cluttered
office
the
information
obtained
was
nothing
more
than
a
simple
statement
I
cant
do
it
without
an
explanation
from
the
person
in
charge.
Although
Frederica
seemed
to
have
some
knowledge
it
would
take
some
time
to
fill
in
the
discrepancies
in
the
information
that
had
been
away
from
the
site
for
a
few
months
and
above
all
if
the
burden
of
maintaining
the
mansion
was
taken
into
consideration
work
would
be
increased.
I
couldnt
do
it.
Emilia
carefully
handles
some
cases
that
can
be
simply
handled
and
the
rest
is
the
same
as
we
know
that
there
will
be
tsuke
that
we
put
off
later.
I
feel
like
Im
on
my
way
to
school
without
doing
all
my
summer
vacation
homework.
Im
kind
of
like
I
didnt
submit
my
homework
or
something.
Im
not
sure
but
its
not
a
good
thing
is
it?
On
the
other
hand
Im
so
sad
now.
Im
not
guilty
but
I
know
its
a
bad
thing
and
leave
it
alone.
Its
not
our
fault.
I
can
open
it
up
again
but
its
difficult
for
Emilia.
I
know
its
uncomfortable
to
see
things
get
worse
in
the
visible
range.
Its
a
toothache
that
has
to
be
left
for
problems
that
arent
good.
I
can
agree
with
the
guilt
feeling
that
Emilia
has
but
it
is
also
true
that
there
is
no
way
to
supplement
it.
After
all
Im
not
strong
enough.
Therefore
I
have
no
choice
but
to
call
the
opponent
who
is
strong
enough.
Im
ready
for
the
Earth
Dragon.
Even
though
its
only
a
few
days
from
such
a
big
job
Natsuki-sans
Patrasche
looks
like
hes
enthusiastic.
Isnt
he
a
good
worker?
I
think
the
former
owner
is
probably
more
dissatisfied
than
the
current
owner.
Im
not
sure
if
Ill
get
lost
or
get
lost
in
the
middle.
Suddenly
what
was
mixed
in
the
conversation
was
Otto
who
had
been
talking
to
the
two
ground
dragons-Patrash
and
Hurufu
at
the
palace
of
the
Dragon
car.
Since
the
protection
of
Kotorei
is
a
protection
that
works
only
for
Otto
his
appearance
of
exchanging
words
with
the
earth
dragon
from
the
side
of
his
eyes
is
the
style
of
a
completely
headed
person
but
I
will
not
mention
it.
Not
realizing
that
<@203488399061942272>
was
sending
a
warm
gaze
Otto
obediently
accepted
only
<@203488399061942272>s
questions
and
nodded
Yes
It
seems
that
there
was
no
problem
as
Mr.
Fredericas
teaching
was
good.
I
think
that
I
can
arrive
in
less
than
half
a
day.
Sokasoka...
But
are
you
really
serious
about
it?
Isnt
that
right?
When
<@203488399061942272>
nodded
to
Otto
who
pressed
the
drum
he
wondered
and
he
stepped
high
on
the
wooden
floor
and
opened
his
eyes
In
any
case
Im
the
first
time
Ive
met
the
frontiers.
I
asked
him
to
introduce
me
but
when
I
imagined
how
Natsuki-san
would
introduce
me
when
I
wasnt...
I
was
scared.
I
cant
do
it
very
much.
Hey
Im
glad
if
you
trust
me
like
that.
Yeah
Im
sure
I
trust
enough
for
a
short
relationship-even
Natsuki-san
isnt
the
kind
of
person
who
can
pull
off
exactly
what
I
dont
want
you
to
do!
When
<@203488399061942272>
bends
his
lips
as
he
is
told
Emilia
who
had
been
silently
listening
until
then
suddenly
spouts
Fufu.
When
all
the
men
looked
at
the
smile
she
raised
her
little
hand
Really
theyre
very
close
friends.
Im
always
jealously
fighting
like
that
so
Im
jealous
of
them.
If
you
want
you
can
get
along
with
Emilia-tan
but
dont
quarrel.
You
can
quarrel
with
Emilia-tan
for
commuttime
with
Otto
and
instead
of
communtime
with
Otto
youll
find
a
good
friend.
Because
it
comes
up
Then
there
will
only
be
abusive
and
hitting
between
me
and
Natsuki-san!
<@203488399061942272>
is
rather
confident
whether
it
is
a
master
of
the
mouth
or
a
bad
person
but
there
is
still
anxiety
in
fighting
Otto
in
a
manual
battle.
Because
I
know
Otto
who
looks
like
a
good
man
but
he
is
a
person
who
is
training
as
such.
I
have
been
thrown
at
the
end
of
the
abusive
game
in
the
previous
loop.
Even
if
we
get
information
that
the
other
person
is
not
an
amateur
we
seem
to
lose
if
we
face
each
other.
Thinking
that
way
my
army
value
is
really
low.
As
mentioned
above
he
lost
to
Otto
and
of
course
he
couldnt
beat
Emilia
with
magic.
Frederica
has
taken
one
splendidly
not
to
mention
Sleeping
REM
and
Beatrice.
Then
<@203488399061942272>
can
win
in
the
mansion
rankings
Oh
by
the
way
I
cant
find
Petra
that
I
could
win
but
what
happened?
Im
afraid
I
cant
ask
how
the
flow
of
winning
wont
win
but
Petra-chan
was
in
the
mansion
just
before...
Ah
it
came
out.
While
Embarrassed
by
<@203488399061942272>
who
is
victorious
in
the
erasure
method
he
is
swaying
and
Emilias
purple-navy
eyes
looking
at
the
mansion
shimmer
faintly.
When
I
was
taken
over
and
looked
at
it
I
saw
a
girl
fluttering
and
swaying
the
hem
of
a
brand-new
dress.
Wait
please
wait.
Suva
<@203488399061942272>...
I
wouldnt
do
it
because
Im
not
Otto
because
Im
not
Otto
if
I
didnt
rush
and
suddenly
started.
Do
you
remember
what
I
said
three
seconds
ago?
With
a
hand
on
her
knees
she
laughs
at
a
girl
who
is
breathtaking
and
<@203488399061942272>
cites
Otto
taps
her
mouth
and
waits
for
her
to
breathe.
Petra
raises
his
face
after
gently
wiping
his
forehead.
The
flushed
cheeks
and
rolling
eyes
are
adorable.
When
she
exhaled
a
long
breath
and
exhausted
herself
she
changed
the
shape
of
the
angel
into
a
smile
I
want
to
give
you
this
before
you
leave.
Please
bring
it.
She
said
to
her
a
plain
handkerchief.
The
edge
of
the
white
cloth
is
colored
in
gold
and
it
conveys
to
the
fingertips
good
quality
and
delicate
production.
If
you
take
it
and
repeat
it
Embroidery...?
Hey
youre
good
at
it.
The
surface
of
the
white
fabric
was
embroidered
probably
Petra
sewn
on.
It
is
drawn
with
gray
pink
and
black
threads
and
it
is
familiar
to
<@203488399061942272>
and
Emilia
who
looked
into
it
from
sideways
laughed
a
little
Aha
The
picture
of
the
pack
drawn
by
<@203488399061942272>
isnt
it?
Its
amazing
its
done
well.
My
deformation
pack
was
well
made.
I
didnt
have
a
chance
to
see
it.
The
stamp
after
Razio
gymnastics
was
pushed
properly
every
morning.
Petra
who
has
forgotten
the
honorific
word
pulls
out
from
the
neck
because
a
stamp
card
made
by
<@203488399061942272>
and
handed
out
to
the
children
of
the
village-every
time
I
participated
in
radio
exercises
every
morning
I
stamped
a
picture
carved
in
the
potato
Thats
what
I
was
giving.
He
sewed
it
hard
with
the
latest
model
that
stopped
at
the
packs
deformed
Depressed
Monday
as
a
model.
But
its
well
done.
I
cant
lose
as
a
sewing
master.
Give
me...
No
do
you?
Will
you
give
me
that?-Of
course
Im
grateful.
I
feel
a
little
bit
scolded
to
wipe
blood
sweat
and
tears
but
Ill
use
it
as
a
talisman
instead.
When
you
fold
the
handkerchief
carefully
carefully
store
it
in
your
chest
and
look
at
Petra.
Then
I
worked
as
hard
as
I
could--from
the
side
I
narrowed
the
evil
eyes
and
turned
a
bad
toothy
smile
on
her.
In
response
Petra
puts
her
hands
on
her
cheeks
that
turn
red
and
she
turns
away
We
are
waiting
for
you
to
return
safely.
Oh
and
my
sister
and
noisy
people.
Something
like
me
is
a
bonus
Now
my
evaluation
wasnt
so
bad!?
Petra
treats
Otto
as
if
it
were
followed
by
Emilia
and
smiles.
In
a
sense
the
scary
goddamn
smile
but
its
hard
to
imagine
Frederica
as
she
begins
to
exhale
a
lot
of
pressure
behind
Petra.
Im
sure
that
after
<@203488399061942272>s
departure
Fredericas
maid
education
will
become
more
severe
and
attack
girls.
Petra
live
strong.
Now
then
its
a
shame
but
its
about
time
to
leave.
Even
if
you
talk
a
lot
here
it
makes
sense
to
leave
early
in
the
morning.
After
giving
up
on
the
atmosphere
that
seems
to
be
bouncing
forever
<@203488399061942272>
puts
his
foot
on
the
dragon
car
and
gets
on
the
luggage
carrier.
Then
reach
out
and
Please
Emilia-tan.
In
my
chest.
Once
in
a
while
it
might
be
nice
to
see
the
scenery
from
the
Odaidai.
Oh
its
uncomfortable!
EMK
Emilia-tan
Maji
Small
devil!
---Wow!
Emilia
passes
by
the
side
of
<@203488399061942272>
who
is
leaning
forward
with
a
gentle
pull
on
his
hand
which
was
almost
treated
and
withdrew.
Her
nose
was
tickled
by
the
dancing
silver
hair
and
her
limbs
landed
on
the
dragon
car
with
a
small
sound.
As
it
is
sit
gently
on
the
face
of
<@203488399061942272>
tilt
it
to
<@203488399061942272>
to
see
it
Whats
wrong?
Unnie
arent
they?
As
he
said
<@203488399061942272>
headed
next
to
her
with
a
strong
footstep
and
sat
down
there.
Emilia
smiles
at
how
to
use
the
tight
space
even
in
a
large
car.
Otto
who
was
watching
the
interaction
between
them
said
I
cant
be
dating
and
sat
down
on
the
pedestal
grasped
the
reins
and
looked
up
at
the
main
gate.
Ill
start
now.
Please
dont
bite
your
tongue.
You
dont
rock
too
much.
When
you
brake
suddenly
ask
with
a
predetermined
signal.
Otherwise
you
cant
push
Emilia-tan
well.
Are
you
thinking
about
that?
I!
I
havent
heard
the
trick
but
before
I
knew
I
was
accompliced?
When
Emilia
turns
her
contemptuous
gaze
to
both
<@203488399061942272>
and
Otto
Otto
yells
at
the
false
charge
but
he
doesnt
get
it.
Susubaru
raises
his
hand
thinking
like
other
peoples
affairs
that
he
would
be
the
best
person
to
scream
unreasonably.
Then
we
are
heading
towards
the
sanctuary
-!
Which
mouth
do
you
say!?
<@203488399061942272>
turned
his
head
out
of
the
window
and
turned
to
the
two
who
were
seeing
off
Then
I
asked
for
my
absence.
And...
Im
asking
you
for
Rem.
Ill
leave
it
to
you.
Instead
thank
you
Emilia
and
her
husband.
Be
careful
and
come
back
safely.
At
the
time
of
parting
Frederica
and
Petra
pick
up
the
ends
of
the
skirt
and
bow
to
the
voice
of
<@203488399061942272>
who
has
lost
his
antics.
After
that
kind
of
polite
interaction
<@203488399061942272>
doesnt
hesitate
anymore--but
unfortunately
if
he
doesnt
hell
cut
his
mind
from
the
mansion
Hey
you
havent
started
yet
Otto.
Its
melting.
Im
not
convinced
this
treatment!
I
ended
the
tension-relieving
exchange
before
departure.
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
I
have
to
teach
my
honorifics
and
how
to
bow
again.
“Im
sorry.
Petras
work
of
peddling
and
bowing
follows
Fredericas
teachings
almost
perfectly.
A
student
who
is
fast
to
learn
swallows
and
really
rewarding.
It
is
not
necessary
to
make
a
blind
eye
because
the
behavior
up
to
the
moment
before
is
appropriate
for
age.
I
know
that
you
had
been
close
to
<@203488399061942272>
and
Emilia
until
the
other
day.
But
now
dont
let
your
servants-employers
be
out
of
your
mind.
--Yes.
Im
really
sorry.
The
girl
knows
well
including
that
her
previous
behavior
was
selfish.
I
could
have
been
able
to
behave
like
that
on
the
spot
as
I
was
taught
and
see
off
<@203488399061942272>.
There
may
be
a
reason
why
she
dared
to
remove
her
role
as
a
servant
and
see
off
<@203488399061942272>
as
a
mere
girl.
The
reason
why
its
small
Its
pointless
to
touch
it.
I
will
add
it
to
the
scribe
in
the
afternoon.
Wow...
do
you
have
more
challenges?
Its
about
that
prepared.
Youre
looking
forward
to
the
future
when
youre
doing
the
right
calculations.
After
saying
clap
your
hands
and
Frederica
will
continue
the
words
Emilia
and
his
friends
are
out
but
Beatrice
is
in
the
mansion.
I
cant
help
but
eat
and
clean.
If
I
dont
finish
it
early
Ill
run
out
of
study
time.
Petra
Hurry
up
and
get
the
job
done
Yes
teacher.
Ill
finish
it
soon!
Fredderikas
mouth
is
slightly
loosened
and
her
tusks
are
exposed
as
she
sees
off
the
girl
who
starts
running.
While
concealing
the
smile
with
his
familiar
gesture
Frederica
saw
the
appearance
of
a
dragon
car
that
was
no
longer
visible
anywhere-looking
at
the
Emilia
who
left
the
mansion.
This
is
exactly
what
Im
telling
you
my
husband.
Whether
its
possible
to
cross
the
sanctuary
and
its
up
to
Emilia
and
<@203488399061942272>.
With
her
eyes
closed
she
bathed
in
the
wind
Can
Emilia-sama
be
crossed
over?
The
paradise
of
an
impenetrable
paradise
bound
by
the
blood
of
a
witch--
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
Then
the
guys
in
the
pack
dont
show
up
all
the
time.
Yeah
yes.
Ive
been
calling
out
a
lot
and
Im
feeling
there
is
even
in
crystalline
stones...
Im
a
little
worried
because
its
the
first
time
Ive
been
out
of
the
table
for
so
long.
Only
the
conversation
between
<@203488399061942272>
and
Emilia
next
to
each
other
resonates
in
the
car
which
is
flying
smoothly.
In
a
dragon
car
under
the
influence
of
Windbreak
protection
noise
systems
such
as
wind
noise
and
outside
noise
are
generally
shut
out.
In
this
way
it
feels
like
a
dream
even
if
you
run
at
a
fairly
high
speed
but
if
you
sway
and
have
minimal
noise.
Or
if
you
have
a
special
seat
on
the
Shinkansen
you
might
be
able
to
feel
such
a
rich
feeling.
However
<@203488399061942272>
has
no
experience
of
getting
into
non-reserved
seats
let
alone
special
seats.
Anyway
in
such
a
quiet
car
the
only
words
exchanged
between
the
two
are
the
sound.
And
the
content
of
the
exchange
has
changed
in
the
past
few
days-it
was
always
beside
Emilia
and
the
absence
of
a
small
cat
acting
as
a
father
who
interferes
with
<@203488399061942272>
who
approaches
her
was
being
talked
about.
When
I
think
back
I
dont
see
my
face
before
returning
to
the
mansion.
I
saw
it
last...
“I
was
in
the
royal
capital
when
I
was
in
Kurshs
mansion.
I
thought
it
was
as
usual
but
for
some
reason
I
couldnt
see
him
from
the
morning.
I
was
worried
but
I
was
anxious.
Looking
down
Emilia
plays
with
her
fingers
on
the
tip
of
her
hair
while
not
showing
her
face
to
<@203488399061942272>.
For
the
past
few
days
her
hairstyle
has
been
fixed
to
braid
it
in
silver.
As
<@203488399061942272>
gazed
at
it
she
nodded
yes
as
she
knew
the
intention
of
her
line
of
sight.
The
last
contract
I
had
with
Puck
was
Hairstyle
Braids.
I
havent
been
told
what
to
do
after
that
so
Im
keeping
this
right
now.
The
contract
with
the
pack
was
really
serious.
Its
so
light...
is
it
light?
The
hair
is
also
the
life
of
a
woman
and
then
the
contract
with
the
pack
has
the
same
meaning
as
holding
it.
I
think
its
a
great
price
to
pay.
I
didnt
know
until
I
left
the
forest
but
I
was
surprised
at
Roswar
that
the
conditions
like
now
are
too
light
to
contract
with
a
pack
of
spirits.
It
requires
a
huge
amount
of
mana
and
complicated
conditions.
<@203488399061942272>
nods
to
think
about
Emilia
who
loosens
her
mouth
forcefully.
But
then
immediately
lifted
the
end
of
his
mouth
to
shake
her
off
her
weak
smile
Well
its
just
a
part
of
Emilia-tans
time
being
tied
up
but
its
a
ridiculous
price
for
me.
If
you
say
that
kind
of
lightly
youll
slip
up.
If
something
important
is
important
Id
like
you
to
save
it
in
a
more
important
time.
Emilias
dissatisfaction
with
<@203488399061942272>s
increasing
number
of
explicit
approaches.
In
response
<@203488399061942272>
lightly
lifted
his
hands
and
shook
his
head
I
have
properly
kept
the
special
lines
that
I
tell
Emilia
when
its
important.
Ive
always
been
there
everyday
and
there
are
a
lot
of
sweet
words
that
I
can
tell
Emilia.
Really
<@203488399061942272>
has
a
good
mouth....No
I
might
have
a
little
red
face
so
dont
look
at
me.
Laughing
at
Emilia
who
turned
her
palm
to
hide
her
face
<@203488399061942272>
confirmed
that
she
had
achieved
her
purpose.
Then
he
continues
the
word
even
if
it
is
so
as
to
return
the
topic.
When
talking
about
the
lack
of
a
pack
Im
seriously
worried
about
my
strength.
This
journey.
Otto
cant
rely
on
mechanics
of
course
I
cant
rely
on
it.
Isnt
it
hard?
Oh
I
say
that.
Ill
tell
you
I
can
use
magic
properly
even
without
a
pack.
I
have
contracts
with
not
only
packs
but
also
children
of
the
spirits.
Communication
with
them.
I
can
fight
because
there
is
no
problem.
I
will
protect
you
even
if
there
is
anything.
No
its
a
boy.
And
Im
sad.
Wait
a
minute
because
Ill
tell
Emilia
what
that
line
will
be.
Ill
wait
without
waiting.
As
evidenced
by
Emilias
words
the
radiance
of
the
spirits
begins
to
drift
as
she
gathers
at
her
fingertips.
Although
it
is
similar
to
Julius
quasi-spirit
its
presence
is
slightly
weaker
than
those
of
them-the
output
may
be
a
cloud
difference
compared
to
the
pack
but
at
least
this
face
is
not
a
group
of
zero
force.
Apparently.
It
is
a
miserable
story
to
say
that
you
have
no
choice
but
to
rely
on
a
group
of
Yui
girls
who
you
love.
I
said
that
in
the
first
place
my
other
power
application
hasnt
changed
since
I
was
a
white
whale.
I
had
to
rely
on
REM
and
even
before
that...
well
Ive
never
survived
by
myself!?

Of
course
its
from
his
point
of
view
and
the
result
is
too
much
underestimation.
Anyway
because
there
wasnt
enough
information
to
listen
to
it
on
the
spot
<@203488399061942272>s
memory
and
astonishment
made
him
feel
remorseful.
But
its
a
sanctuary.
What
is
it
really
like?
After
finishing
a
single
reflection
<@203488399061942272>
murmuredly
while
gazing
at
the
scenery
from
the
small
window.
I
think
I
heard
the
word
sanctuary
itself
when
I
was
probably
looping
in
a
mansion-while
I
was
caught
in
a
second
loop
in
this
world.
The
result
is
that
I
missed
the
opportunity
to
talk
about
sanctuary
as
it
is
and
procrastinately
procrastinated.
I
once
went
to
the
sanctuary
as
an
evacuation
from
the
Witches
but
that
wasnt
possible
because
of
the
evil
force
of
Petergius.
As
a
result
the
sanctuary
is
only
an
unknown
place
for
<@203488399061942272>.
Although
there
is
no
dangerous
image
due
to
its
popular
name
some
notes
given
by
Fredericas
mouth
along
with
the
sanctuary
tighten
the
loosening
thoughts.
Above
all
Watch
out
for
the
garfeel
right?
I
havent
met
<@203488399061942272>.
Ive
only
heard
his
name.
Frederica
didnt
tell
me
the
details.
In
a
form
that
rides
on
<@203488399061942272>s
murmur
Emilia
worries
her
well-prepared
eyebrows.
Perhaps
she
thinks
of
the
same
scene
as
<@203488399061942272>.
An
act
with
Frederica
who
named
Garfield
as
a
noteworthy
person
but
refused
to
mention
it
further.
When
<@203488399061942272>
complained
that
she
was
disguised
as
a
small
piece
of
information
she
stubbornly
refused
to
say
a
word
because
of
her
pledge.
For
some
reason
Emilia
and
others
pulled
it
back.
I
should
have
asked
him
out.
I
think
he
knows
only
the
name
of
someone
he
knows
is
a
dangerous
person
or
hes
too
picked
up.
Its
okay
its
a
pledge.
The
promise
is
sacred
inviolable
never
invaded.
Treat
the
contract
the
covenant
and
the
pledge
but
treat
them
with
the
same
weight
but
with
the
same
hardness.
Shaking
his
raised
finger
Emilia
says
that
to
<@203488399061942272>.
While
listening
to
those
who
can
only
think
of
word
play
as
contracts
pledges
to
covenants
I
put
my
doubts
on
my
tongue
The
contract
between
Emilia
Tan
and
Puck
is
a
contract.
It
is
a
pledge
that
Frederica
cant
give
in
to
Rozzi
so
its
okay
for
the
kingdom
to
make
an
agreement
with
the
dragon...?
Is
it
something
different?
Im
not
saying
that
Im
using
them
to
that
extent
but
I
think
contracts
are
commitments
between
individuals.
Pledges
are
commitments
from
one
to
the
other.
I
think
a
pledge
is
one
that
can
be
concluded
over
individuals
and
over
time.
I
was
taught
that
way.
I
see.
Is
that
sure
enough
to
meet
the
conditions?
Nodding
to
Emilias
explanation
he
subtly
scratched
his
head
and
continued
to
say
but
Youve
decorated
it
with
a
very
generous
speech.
Is
the
promise
sacred
and
inviolable?
Promises...
Promises
are
important.
Of
course
promises
are
important
but
even
contracts
dont
really
have
the
force
to
keep
them.
No
but
they
do
keep
promises.
No
matter
who
you
look
at
or
who
you
dont
realize
you
keep
your
promise.
With
his
hands
on
his
chest
Emilia
stares
at
<@203488399061942272>
who
asks
with
a
light
feeling.
The
tone
is
soft
and
there
is
no
feeling
to
blame.
Because
of
that
my
chest
is
painful.
Believing
that
I
can
do
my
best
to
fulfill
the
promises
I
have
made.
Promises
are
to
connect
that
trust
with
each
other
right?
Im
really
sorry
about
that
section-huh!
Crawling
on
the
floor
in
a
car
that
doesnt
feel
shaking
<@203488399061942272>
heads
straight
down.
In
front
of
DOGEZA
who
rubs
his
forehead
on
the
floor
Emilias
eyes
blinked
astonishingly
and
a
few
seconds
later
she
recalled
her
own
remarks
and
<@203488399061942272>s
action
seemed
to
come
to
a
point.
Ah
I
didnt
blame
<@203488399061942272>.
<@203488399061942272>
didnt
keep
his
promise
with
me
and
he
reopened
without
apologizing
for
that
so
I
also
said
Whats
this?
Its
true
that
it
happened.
It
hurts
hurts
my
ears
hurt!
I
also
regretted
that
I
was
too
one-sided
later.
It
was
a
pitiful
thing
that
I
did
not
go
to
make
up
with
<@203488399061942272>
immediately.
Im
sorry.
It
hurts
it
hurts
my
chest
hurts!
There
may
have
been
places
where
I
thought
about
the
promises
too
much
and
deeply.
I
see
Im
a
spiritist
so
Im
closer
to
contracts
and
ordinary
people.
For
spiritists
contracts
with
spirits
are
more
important
than
anything
else.
Its
something
I
should
respect
so
Im
irritable...
Yeah
for
me
promises
are
very
very
important.
After
all
<@203488399061942272>
remorse.
It
hurts
it
hurts
my
heart
hurts!
While
I
was
saying
I
was
reminded
of
the
real
conflict
at
that
time
maybe
<@203488399061942272>
was
a
low
head
in
front
of
Emilia
who
started
to
feel
a
little
tired.
This
made
it
clear
why
she
was
so
upset
at
the
royal
waiting
room.
I
wasnt
angry
just
because
I
broke
my
promise.
For
her
promises
were
terribly
heavy
in
their
own
right.
<@203488399061942272>
who
broke
it
lightly
couldnt
be
calm
even
if
she
was
kind.
<@203488399061942272>
unknowingly
trampled
on
something
important
in
Emilias
heart.
Did
you
reflect?
Reflected.
Deeper
than
the
sea
higher
than
the
mountains
wider
than
the
sky
magnificent
than
the
universe.
Okay
then
forgive
me.
With
a
finger
lightly
thrust
<@203488399061942272>s
forehead
up
Emilia
smiles
thinly
when
she
puts
her
finger
on
her
lips.
Its
a
relief
that
there
is
no
feeling
of
anger
and
the
continued
gestures
are
so
cute
that
<@203488399061942272>
cant
say
anything.
Unaware
of
<@203488399061942272>s
mouth
which
is
like
a
breathing
fish
Emilia
suddenly
turned
her
head
toward
the
direction
of
movement
“Garfeel
in
the
“sanctuary.”
And
Roswar
and
the
villagers...
there
are
so
many
people
that
I
have
to
talk
to
and
Im
thrilled
from
now
on.”
Well
Im
afraid
Emilia-tan
isnt
a
good
match
for
my
eyes.
Trust
me
in
Shield
2.
Is
it
the
second?
Then
the
first?
Now
Im
flirting
with
my
Patrache
while
playing
the
Dragon
Car.
<@203488399061942272>
who
calls
Otto
a
shield
of
flesh
with
a
strange
face
Emilia
squirts
out
this
time.
So
happy
that
her
smile
popped
<@203488399061942272>
thinks
of
the
many
gates
waiting
for
her
as
she
said.
Since
coming
to
another
world
problems
have
continued
one
after
another
without
any
time
to
rest.
Despite
being
on
the
way
to
the
sanctuary
its
more
anxious
than
the
expectation
of
a
place
we
havent
seen
yet.
At
any
rate
Frederica
was
directly
fueled
by
it
and
there
were
many
suspicions
that
the
villagers
including
Roswar
would
not
return.
In
addition
<@203488399061942272>
himself
has
a
lot
of
regrets
that
the
pack
does
not
respond
to
the
call
and
leaves
anxiety
in
the
mansion.
Did
you
think
about
Rem?
……Recognize?
Emilia
tilts
her
head
as
she
stares
at
the
silent
side
profile
of
<@203488399061942272>.
Her
gestures
had
her
silver
hair
slipping
off
her
shoulders
and
she
picked
the
tip
of
her
with
her
finger
and
shook
the
braids
tail
saying
I
understand.
You
could
think
that
Im
watching
<@203488399061942272>
just
as
much
as
<@203488399061942272>
is
watching
me.
Then
does
Emilia
mean
that
youre
staring
at
me
all
the
time?
Oh
after
all
about
half
of
that
half
That
means
three
hours...!
Half
of
that
half...
If
you
listen
to
the
correct
number
it
will
hurt
you
so
much!
<@203488399061942272>
spilled
a
small
sigh
and
scratched
his
cheek
asking
Emilia
who
would
try
to
find
a
realistic
number
by
cutting
it
into
small
pieces.
I
leave
it
to
Frederica
and
Petra
and
Im
not
worried.
I
dont...
I
cant
put
this
anxiety
into
my
words
which
shouldnt
be
there.
Im
worried
that
Im
worried
because
its
a
concern.
Thats
what
matters.
Its
a
bit
envious
of
me
to
think
so.
To
tell
you
the
same
thing
I
mean
Emilia-san...
I
guess
I
was
trying
to
say
this
right
now?
Yeah
I
mean.
Sorry.
All
is
forgiven
by
just
apologizing
with
the
tongue
out.
In
front
of
<@203488399061942272>s
throat
thumping
Emilia
looked
up
at
me
but
Im
more
concerned
about
Beatrice.
...Isnt
Emilia-tan
just
in
touch
with
me?
Youve
seen
the
ending
completely.
Although
I
usually
hate
Im
not
worried
I
dont
see
it
today.
Wow
worried
evidence.
There
is
no
sound
of
being
hit
by
the
star
and
<@203488399061942272>
bites
his
lips
and
looks
regrettable.
However
immediately
that
expression
was
filled
with
another
expression
Im
not
worried
but
I
couldnt
meet
even
once
after
I
finally
felt
like
having
a
quarrel.
Its
just
a
little
sick
because
I
cant
see
you
in
the
mansion.
Yes
its
just
a
little
bit.
Its
just
this
way
only
the
first
time.
It
sounds
like
an
obscene
word
but
I
wonder
if
its
because
of
it.
No
its
my
fault.
While
subscribing
to
the
slightly
targeted
part
and
hiding
that
Im
happy
<@203488399061942272>
smiles
while
watching
Emilia
who
tilts
her
head
without
understanding
the
meaning.
If
that
makes
Barekos
withdrawal
even
worse
I
think
that
the
former
withdrawal
is
very
responsible.
Withdrawal...
<@203488399061942272>
is
surely
familiar
with
that.
Beatrice
is
this
right?
Its
difficult
isnt
it?
You
cant
pull
it
forcibly
without
a
great
deal
of
effort
but
its
too
spicy
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
slowly.
Let
me...
oh!
I
was
too!
When
the
usual
punch
is
attached
the
direction
of
the
topic
is
corrected.
Anyway
the
conclusion
is
postponed
since
it
is
decided
to
go
to
the
sanctuary.
When
I
get
back
I
have
to
talk
to
Bearko
in
various
ways.
After
all
I
cant
hear
what
I
had
to
say.
I
feel
like
I
am
hiding
both
Beatrice
and
the
pack
knowing
something.
“I
agree
with
you.
Like
Frederica
the
people
involved
in
the
mansion
have
a
tendency
to
postpone
the
answer
by
saying
something
that
seems
to
be
irrelevant.
Im
sick
anymore.
Just
say
something
you
care
about.
The
Gospel
which
was
returned
to
Beatrice
along
with
his
illusory
words
is
still
kept
in
the
hands
of
<@203488399061942272>.
It
would
have
been
okay
to
leave
it
as
baggage
but
in
the
worst
case
I
brought
it
because
there
is
also
a
way
to
ask
Roswar.
Its
creepy
so
Id
like
to
hide
it
quietly
at
the
bottom
of
the
bag.
--
It
looks
like
youve
entered
the
forest
Said
Emilia
who
lifted
her
face
up
removed
her
bangs
on
her
forehead
with
her
fingers
and
looked
around
and
uttered
such
a
thing.
Susubaru
raises
his
face
as
a
result
but
the
truth
of
the
words
cannot
be
confirmed
from
inside
the
dragon
car.
When
you
walk
up
to
the
small
window
and
look
out
you
can
see
that
the
shades
of
green
are
certainly
deeper.
I
didnt
even
look
outside
but
I
understand.
Its
a
mixture
but
it
also
contains
the
blood
of
an
elf.
The
elf
and
forest
are
inseparable
enough
to
be
said
to
be
a
family
of
the
forest.
And
then
when
Emilia
was
talking
with
a
fleeting
smile.
The
feeling
of
tingling
stimulates
<@203488399061942272>s
skin
lightly
and
<@203488399061942272>
looks
around
for
something.
Of
course
something
visible
was
not
the
one
that
affected
me.
The
inside
of
the
dragon
car
is
still
separated
from
the
outside
by
the
protection
of
the
wind
shield.
However
-!?
Hey
hey!
「――――」
<@203488399061942272>s
slip-in
catches
as
Emilias
thin
body
shakes
and
she
is
about
to
fall
unprotected.
Emilia
hugged
herself
as
if
she
was
sliding
on
the
floor
and
she
was
weak
and
her
eyes
closed
her
in
a
painful
look
and
a
small
panting.
Eh
Emilia!?
What
is
Emilia!?
Emilia
seems
unable
to
reply.
It
is
painful
but
except
for
shallow
and
fast
breathing
and
facial
expression
he
has
neither
heat
nor
sweat.
Lifting
her
body
lightly
<@203488399061942272>
immediately
determined
that
she
could
not
speak
herself.
When
I
rushed
to
the
front
of
the
dragon
car
and
plunged
my
head
roughly
into
the
small
window
connected
to
the
Odaidai
Otto!
Somehow
dangerous
Emilia
suddenly
fell
down!
Something
like
medicine...
Ah
Natsuki
sorry.
The
frustrated
<@203488399061942272>
words
are
cut
off.
Otto
who
should
have
been
uttered
a
voice
sweated
on
his
forehead
turning
his
voice
away
from
his
voice.
Two
changes
I
noticed
are:
First
the
dragon
car
is
stopped.
Patrache
and
Hulhu
are
two
stalled
and
stuck
in
a
flock
of
trees.
It
was
a
sensational
flapping
that
I
couldnt
even
notice
the
stop
but
more
problems
were
now
occurring.
That
was
the
second
big
change-
From
the
front
again
its
a
good
feeling
isnt
it?
Unlike
the
letters
the
words
that
seem
to
be
thrown
away
do
not
carry
a
slight
amount
of
friendly
feelings.
A
statement
that
only
one
word
can
tell
the
personality
of
the
person
who
said
it.
The
impression
is
correct
and
it
does
not
betray
the
appearance
of
the
person
standing
in
front
of
the
dragon
car.
White
scars
on
the
forehead
are
conspicuous
on
the
short
upright
blonde.
His
sharp
eyes
are
as
ferocious
as
<@203488399061942272>
who
has
been
scolded
by
his
three-eyed
eyes.
The
mans
height
which
was
rolled
up
on
his
back
was
low
for
men
but
his
ferocious
spirit
was
leaking
from
his
whole
body
to
the
extent
that
he
could
not
discourage
others
from
being
petite.
I
dont
know
who
it
is
he
said
The
more
piercing
a
pile
is
the
more
fragile
it
is.
Hey?
When
<@203488399061942272>
uttered
a
stunned
voice
for
a
phrase
he
had
never
heard
he
might
have
decided
that
the
other
person
who
heard
it
was
freaking
out
laughing
like
a
breath
of
breath
Ah?
Im
so
scared
hey.
Certainly
we
are
unlucky.
Anyway
the
place
I
tried
to
sneak
in
was
the
place
and
I
was
the
only
one
who
met
me.
The
man
laughed
ferociously
squeezed
his
teeth
like
a
fank
and
put
his
fists
on
top
of
each
other
to
lower
himself
and
prepare
for
battle.
With
that
attitude
I
looked
up
at
me
without
words
Im
out
of
luck
before
this
Garfir-sama.
Its
kind
of
like
Bazomaso
flowing
right
to
left!
The
thug
who
called
himself
so
much
stepped
on
the
ground
cutting
a
pomp
that
didnt
convey
his
intention.
Immediately
afterwards
a
subversive
shock
hit
the
<@203488399061942272>s.

There
are
people
who
can
get
into
peoples
mind
and
control
their
memories.
This
power
is
used
to
eradicate
mysteries
and
cases
or
worse
to
assassinate.
The
potential
of
the
said
power
is
strong
enough
that
it
is
able
to
destroy
peoples
mind
however
can
backfire
and
eat
up
their
own
heart.
To
counter
it
chains
are
used
to
lock
and
protect
each
others
weak
and
dangerous
heart.
From
ones
growing
fear
and
disdain
theyre
consequently
called
as
a
Pet.

might

Summary:
Sakurai
Shinichis
one
wish
is
for
a
little
peace
and
quiet.
But
Uzaki
Hana–his
boisterous
well-endowed
underclassman–has
other
plans.
All
she
wants
is
to
hang
out
and
poke
fun
at
him.
With
the
help
of
her
chipper
charm
and
peppy
persistence
this
might
just
be
the
start
of
a
beautiful
relationship!

REMEMBER
BEGINNING
OF

BEING
KICKED
OUT
AND
THIS
MANGA
HAD
ME
LAUGHING
MY
DICK
OFF...
IT
ALL
started
when
I
seen
people
in
Japan
were
mad
that
the
Red
Cross
was
using
her
to
appeal
to
young
males
so
they
would
get
interested
in
donating
blood!
ahahhaa!

of

So
uhh
I
just
went
and
checked
what
Uzaki-Chan
wa
Asobitai
was
about
and
I
can
understand
the
hate
behind
it
tbh.
Its
just
another
fanservice
anime
with
a
Big
titted
loli.
No
wonder
people
are
fed
up.

I
get
where
your
coming
from
but
the
fact
that
she
looks
like
a
loli
does
not
mean
she
is
a
loli
she
literally
says
in
the
show
herself
in
anger
to
the
Cafe
Owner
Im
in
College!
4:13
seconds
into
episode
3
and
there
are
people
in
the
world
the
same
height
as
Uzaki-Chan
with
a
big
chest
she
is
4
foot
9
inches
or
150
cm
tall
with
a
90
cm
bust
size
my
friend
is
one
of
these
people
how
common
they
are
I
have
no
Idea
but
people
in
the
world
like
Uzaki
Chan
do
exist
and
the
artist
of
the
manga
just
happened
to
draw
someone
like
Uzaki
and
stuck
with
her
design.
It
may
be
fanservice
related
too
but
it
was
the
artist
and
writers
decision
to
design
Uzaki
the
way
they
did
and
she
most
definitely
is
not
a
Loli
she
is
19
years
old
in
chapter
1
of
the
manga
and
is
20
years
old
by
chapter
22
plus
Sakurai
and
Uzaki
have
known
each
other
since
high
school
and
are
only
a
year
apart
in
age
from
each
other
so
if
they
ever
hooked
up
which
probably
will
happen
it
would
be
completely
legal
and
while
yes
Uzaki-Chan
does
have
some
Uncommon
proportions
compared
to
the
average
woman
that
does
not
mean
women
of
her
proportions
dont
exist
and
people
who
say
Uzaki
is
unrealistic
and
doesnt
look
how
a
woman
should
look
have
probably
insulted
and
maybe
offended
the
women
out
there
who
do
look
like
Uzaki-Chan
without
taking
their
feelings
into
consideration
and
how
they
might
relate
to
this
character
and
another
thing
is
These
characters
are
completely
fictional
and
nothing
they
do
affects
the
real
world
not
to
mention
Japanese
Manga
artists
who
are
independent
or
apart
of
small
and
some
big
manga
companies
in
Japan
dont
care
about
what
you
think
about
their
character
and
they
will
do
what
they
want.

Its
really
not
that
fanservicy
tbh
the
only
thing
remotely
close
to
it
is
the
fact
the
main
female
character
has
big
boobs
and
is
pretty
fucking
stupid.
Its
pretty
wholesome
otherwise
if
you
find
a
problem
with
the
show
it
is
probably
because
youre
looking
at
it
from
its
surface
value.

With
a
shocked
attitude
<@203488399061942272>
opened
her
eyes
to
the
blonde
girl
who
stared
at
her.
Minerva
is
a
witch
who
fills
Aos
eyes
with
extravagant
anger
and
puts
red
on
her
beautiful
face.
After
shooting
a
rigid
<@203488399061942272>
with
a
strong
line
of
sight
she
looked
at
Echidna
standing
in
front
of
her
without
losing
her
posture.
I
repeat
Ill
wait.
I
wont
accept
the
contract.
...Hmm.
This
should
be
an
unexpected
development
for
me.
Hostility
is
familiar
and
anger
is
overkill.
Minerva
folded
his
arms
into
the
crater
of
his
fist
striking
it
all
at
once
in
Echidna
biting
his
lips
with
a
rich
bouncing
of
his
chest.
The
Witchs
Contract-Youre
not
sure
you
dont
understand
what
that
means.
Youre
still
going
to
interrupt...
Maybe
you
want
to
make
a
contract
with
him
too?
I
mean...
I
dont
you
know
Im
angry
like
this
for
no
such
peaceful
reason?
Im
so
angry.
Im
outraged.
Im
rushing
to
angry
hair.
In
response
to
Echidnas
words
which
she
tries
to
dodge
lightly
Minervas
response
that
deepens
the
shade
of
red
on
her
face.
The
high
emotions
make
the
tears
drop
in
the
air
and
the
nice
profile
makes
you
feel
like
the
stubbornness
of
a
baby.
The
abundant
flesh
and
the
young
side
profile
are
endlessly
unbalanced-and
the
existence
itself
is
a
surprise
for
<@203488399061942272>
today.
Because
Why
are
you
here?
What?
Do
I
have
to
be
here?
No
no.
Not
but...
because
Echidna
is
there.
Pointing
at
Echidna
<@203488399061942272>
says
to
Minerva
who
is
swelling
his
cheeks
dissatisfied.
Minerva
still
tilts
his
head
as
if
he
can
not
understand
but
Echidna
seems
to
be
able
to
understand
what
<@203488399061942272>
wants
to
say
and
nods
when
he
taps
his
hand
lightly
Oh
I
figured
out
what
you
were
talking
about.-Its
no
wonder
that
Im
here
to
see
another
witch.
Well
thats
right
because
Ive
always
had
a
one-on-one
face-to-face
relationship
with
other
witches...
it
was
my
promise
to
appear
here
instead
of
Echidna.
Im
not
saying
you
cant
go
out
together.
Its
the
evil
witchs
way
of
doing
that
kind
of
prank.
Minerva
knocks
down
<@203488399061942272>s
counterargument
making
his
shoulders
angry.
To
that
answer
<@203488399061942272>
murmured
No
way
and
looked
at
Echidna
only
in
his
mouth.
However
Echidna
did
not
show
any
negative
stance
either
in
<@203488399061942272>s
gaze
or
Minervas
words.
“Dont
get
me
wrong.
Calling
a
witch
other
than
me
to
this
place
is
a
heavy
burden
and
risk
to
me.
In
some
cases
another
witch
may
take
the
initiative
in
this
place.
There
is
and
if
not
it
takes
a
lot
of
effort
to
form
a
strong
being
like
them.
Thats...
no
but
you...
The
lie
shouldnt
have
been
lost
once.
Lets
assert
that.
Echidna
breaks
the
words
of
<@203488399061942272>s
replacement
with
one
sharp
word.
Its
a
fact.
Looking
back
on
my
memory
Echidna
has
never
made
a
statement
about
the
current
phenomenon
that
could
deny
a
lie.
In
the
face
of
the
phenomena
and
facts
presented
<@203488399061942272>123123
just
assumed
yes.
So
as
a
matter
of
extreme
theory
Echidna
had
nothing
after
cheating
<@203488399061942272>.
I
didnt
want
you
to
be
taken
by
other
witches
because
I
knew
that
other
witches
could
manifest
themselves.
What?
Youve
been
a
guest
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
to
me.
I
wasnt
so
excited
about
talking
to
me
before
and
after
my
death.
Its
a
shame
I
want
to
monopolize
your
existence
at
least
here.
Are
you
abusive?
「――――」
I
will
give
you
back
again
but
I
like
you
better
so
by
taking
out
a
witch
thats
more
attractive
or
more
supportive
than
others
I
keep
your
interest
from
moving
to
other
witches.
I
wanted
it.-It
doesnt
matter
if
you
laugh.
Its
a
terrible
ugly
monopoly--
explains
Echidna
explaining
the
story
behind
the
secret.
With
no
words
listening
to
something
like
Echidnas
excuse
<@203488399061942272>
thinks
that
she
has
an
attachment-thats
what
she
has.
The
same
goes
for
Jealous
witch.
Why
Echidna
is
so
<@203488399061942272>?
Whats
going
to
be
rolled
up
easily
you?
-Is
it!?
A
soft
fist
was
poking
from
behind
from
<@203488399061942272>s
head
who
was
thinking
about
it.
If
you
hold
your
head
and
look
back
Minerva
is
right
behind
you.
She
takes
<@203488399061942272>s
hand
on
her
head
and
in
a
fluent
motion
pulls
her
joints
to
the
ground
extremely.
Oh
hey
it
hurts
it
hurts...
isnt
it?
If
I
directly
touched
the
creature
it
would
be
a
treatment
instead
of
the
treatment.
Even
if
I
hit
it
with
all
my
strength
the
wound
will
be
blocked
even
if
I
bring
it
to
sleep
with
the
intention
of
squeezing
it
my
chronic
disease
will
heal
and
if
I
continue
the
joint
technique
I
will
have
a
shoulder
stiffness
Will
be
eliminated!
Oh
the
creaks
on
the
body...
<@203488399061942272>
desperately
twists
her
neck
and
looks
up
at
Minerva
who
is
extremely
articulate
while
enjoying
the
true
value
of
The
Witch
of
Rage
with
her
body.
Despite
the
fact
that
the
bones
are
crooked
and
bent
in
a
direction
that
complains
of
pain
it
feels
awful
because
the
warmth
rather
than
the
pain
spreads
throughout
the
body.
A
witch
who
exerts
a
mysterious
power
on
the
human
body
in
which
all
actions
are
reduced
to
positive
factors-I
have
never
had
a
negative
impression
on
her
What
on
earth
is
this...
If
you
dont
do
it
this
way
youll
be
on
the
stake
with
Echidna
and
youll
get
a
deal.
That
careless
judgment
and
a
mind-stopping
attitude
Im
annoyed!
It
doesnt
sound
like
a
muzzle.
Im
going
to
explain
the
benefits
of
having
a
firm
contract
with
me
and
have
a
mutual
agreement...
I
dont
like
that
kind
of
accountability.
Ive
been
able
to
explain
the
advantages.
I
did...
but
about
the
disadvantages
of
contracting
You
didnt
say
anything!
Minerva
swings
his
legs
down
in
anger.
At
the
position
of
the
heel
there
is
a
butt
of
<@203488399061942272>
that
is
pulled
down
and
you
can
experience
the
mysterious
phenomenon
that
the
heel
is
screwed
into
the
buttocks
and
the
ground
where
the
impact
is
transmitted
through
the
buttocks
collapses.
<@203488399061942272>
is
astounded
by
the
meaning
of
Minervas
words
remembering
that
his
blow
to
the
hips
improved
his
communication.
-The
fact
that
you
did
not
mention
the
disadvantages
in
the
conversation
with
Echidna.
Thats
because
I
realized
that
I
hadnt
even
noticed
it.
No
but...
saying
that
there
is
a
disadvantage...
to
such
a
big
thing
You
think
it
shouldnt
happen
do
you
think
so?
Youre
looking
at
the
contract
very
sweetly
let
alone
the
witch-the
most
contracted
and
the
most
of
the
seven
witches
named
after
the
deadly
sins.
The
Greedy
Witch
who
interacted
with
humans
and
interfered
with
history
most
strongly.
Its
true
that
its
not
all
honors
in
life...
honor
but
its
true
that
having
signed
a
contract
with
me
did
not
save
all
beings.
Minerva
points
out
a
fact
that
<@203488399061942272>
did
not
know.
Echidna
insists
that
he
has
no
harm
to
<@203488399061942272>
while
continuing
to
supplement
the
words.
While
listening
to
the
claims
of
both
parties
<@203488399061942272>s
head
which
was
sandwiched
between
them
was
at
the
height
of
confusion.
I
dont
know
which
statement
to
believe.
Echidna
seems
to
be
a
kind
of
comrade
who
has
been
face-to-face
with
the
trial
at
the
graveyard
and
faced
many
times
with
<@203488399061942272>s
troubles.
It
was
the
person
who
had
the
impression.
Thats
why
<@203488399061942272>
tried
to
remember
even
half-heartedly
her
words
that
she
suggested
to
form
a
cooperation
system
in
the
form
of
a
contract.
Minerva
on
the
other
hand
has
less
contact
less
time
and
less
words
than
Echidna.
However
they
are
all
benevolent
people
who
treat
<@203488399061942272>
in
a
critical
situation
with
the
healing
power
released
from
their
powerful
arm
and
overshoot
like
a
typhoon
without
even
asking
words
of
thanks.
There
is
no
reason
for
Minerva
to
fall
into
<@203488399061942272>
and
it
should
be
thought
that
there
is
no
reason
for
her
to
come
to
such
a
manifestation.
No
in
the
first
place
there
was
something
to
ask
before
questioning.
that
is--.
Echidna.
If
you
sign
a
contract
youll
need
to
pay
for
it.
...Yeah
yeah.
The
contract
needs
it.
Just
as
I
provide
knowledge
to
you
you
have
to
offer
it
to
me.
Yeah.
Yes.-so
what
do
you
want
from
me?
If
you
contract
with
you
what
do
I
need
to
offer
you?
What
should
I
pay
for
the
existence
of
Echidna
to
help
when
<@203488399061942272>
is
in
a
stalemate
or
when
it
is
unavoidable?
Equidna
suddenly
loosens
her
cheek
when
asked
by
<@203488399061942272>.
I
dont
have
to
be
that
vigilant.
Its
not
that
hard
for
me
to
ask
you.
Rather
Im
not
conscientious
enough
to
pay
for
something
that
is
tangible
or
insignificant.
You
can
even
say
that.
--What
do
you
want?
Its
easy.-what
you
felt
what
you
thought
what
you
remember
something
you
know
something
you
do
something
born
of
you.
I
want
you
to
continue
to
enjoy
the
fruit
of
unknown
that
derives
from
you.
Echidna
blushed
and
said
with
a
look
like
a
maiden
in
love.
The
fruit
of
Unknown-<@203488399061942272>s
frenzy
is
struck
by
its
poetic
language.
What
thats
what
I
mean
if
I
take
out
emotions
memories
memories
and
things
like
that
and
thats
what
I
mean...
I
didnt
say
that.
Its
not
that
kind
of
talk.
I
just
want
to
see
the
scenery
you
see
the
melody
you
hear
the
story
you
spin
in
the
seats
of
the
audience.
I
just
want
to
feel
it.
What?
I
want
to
be
in
a
position
to
know
the
unknown
that
is
born
of
you.
It
is
enough
to
satisfy
me.
To
dispel
<@203488399061942272>s
concerns
Echidna
makes
clear
what
she
wants.
Just
look
at
the
way
<@203488399061942272>
walks.
Seeing
the
scenery
along
the
way
together.
To
know
what
<@203488399061942272>
felt
to
know
to
know
the
result
of
the
action.
A
witch
who
has
acquired
the
desire
for
knowledge
and
who
bears
greed
demands
only
that.
Isnt
it
a
lie?
In
addition
to
telling
a
lie
in
a
contract.
I
swear
I
will
never
disobey
this
word
because
I
am
myself.
You
can
bet
your
life.
Echidna
puts
her
hand
on
her
chest
and
concludes
with
a
light-hearted
attitude
Im
already
dead
though.
The
attitude
and
words
made
<@203488399061942272>
feel
like
there
was
no
lie.
Or
maybe
you
just
want
to
believe
that.
Minerva.
Echidna
says
ah.
Ill
see
him
then...
Hey
all...
its
true
but...
I
didnt
say
it
all
right?
<@203488399061942272>
tries
to
demand
the
release
of
Minerva
who
is
detained
but
this
time
another
voice
is
called.
Thats
just
a
dozen
minutes
ago-a
voice
that
<@203488399061942272>
never
feels
comfortable
with.
Kamira...
The
witch
of
lust!
Oh
what...
Im
scared
I
dont
see.
Im
telling
you...
Im
not
doing
anything...
ni...
terrible...
The
poor
eyesight
is
natural.
You
dont
have
to
be
special
and
tough.
<@203488399061942272>
pulled
down
to
the
ground
and
Echidna
standing
in
front
of
it.
A
red-haired
girl
sits
on
a
meadow
a
little
farther
away
while
Minerva
behind
her
is
lined
up
in
a
straight
line:
Carmilla.
As
she
hides
her
face
from
<@203488399061942272>s
line
of
sight
she
is
flirting
with
each
other.
As
always
its
a
frustrating
attitude
but
by
consciously
distracting
her
from
being
she
avoids
being
endangered
at
the
risk
of
life.
After
that
I
asked
many
questions.
Right
what
did
you
just
say?
I
dont
complain
about
another
witch
showing
her
face
now
but
whats
wrong...
Eh
Echidna-chan...
Im
hiding
there
are
so
many
things...?
No
Im
not
telling
you...
Im
hiding
Im
hiding...
Hiding
it...?
<@203488399061942272>
looks
at
Echidna
as
if
he
were
entwined
considering
the
meaning
of
Carmiras
words.
On
the
other
hand
Echidna
grabs
one
eye
while
looking
at
the
suddenly
appearing
Carmira
If
you
think
it
came
out
suddenly
itll
be
a
disgrace
to
you.
Why
do
you
call
him
attention
in
the
first
place?
There
shouldnt
be
one.
I
would
have
hated
him.
Like
Minerva-chan
but...
why
right?
Theres
no
such
thing.
No
but
Echidna-chan...
Wow
deceived
me...
was
it?
In
response
to
Echidnas
orderly
sayings
Carmila
who
faces
her
responds
with
a
weak
voice
in
a
choppy
manner
while
keeping
his
eyes
closed.
However
contrary
to
the
weakness
of
the
voice
there
is
no
weak
compromise
in
the
content.
Carmilla
wanders
with
a
restless
gaze
staring
at
Echidna
many
times
Wow
Im
this
kid...
you
dont
like
it
but
I
tricked
me...
eh
Echidna-chans
ally
dont
you
dont
you?
Dont
cheat
or
hate
me
Ri...yes
people
who
do
something
disgusting...Never
forgive
――Only
the
last
word
sounded
very
clear
and
clear.
For
that
reason
<@203488399061942272>
takes
a
moment
to
swallow
the
fact
that
it
was
what
the
girl
beside
said.
That
said
only
one
word
at
a
time
was
far
from
the
girls
previous
mood.
However
「――――」
Carmilla
staring
at
Echidna
silently
but
never
looking
away.
The
whirlpool
of
emotions
that
are
difficult
to
put
into
words
in
those
twins--a
gruesome
dark
thing
that
never
allows
anyone
to
turn
their
enmity
toward
them
and
similar
emotions.
A
lump
of
self-love-suddenly
such
a
sentence
grazes
my
mind.
Although
it
was
a
necessary
step
it
was
a
failure
to
do
something
that
Carmilla
didnt
do.
Its
awkward
to
turn
you
into
an
enemy.
Mina
my
ally...
I
mean
if
you
hate
me
its
terrible...
Ah
apologize
I
wont
forgive
you...
Weakness
and
warlikeness
are
not
equal.
Carmilla
is
a
retreat
and
has
a
weak
personality
that
she
cant
even
satisfactorily
convey
her
words
to
others-and
her
high
resistance
to
hostility
is
irrelevant.
From
a
while
ago...
what
are
you
talking
about?
Then
while
being
caught
in
the
harsh
air
of
such
witches
<@203488399061942272>
who
had
previously
blocked
the
freedom
of
words
raises
his
voice.
Feeling
the
three
pairs
of
gazes
of
the
witch
pouring
down
on
her
<@203488399061942272>
shook
her
head
Give
me
a
talk
over
there!
Im
the
one
I
choose!
Talk
to
me
so
I
know!
What
is
Echidna
hiding!?
What
do
you
guys
know?
Im
trying
to
stop
me!
Even
if
youre
weak
its
too
sweet
to
stop
thinking
and
grab
your
stretched
hand
right
away...
I
guess
youve
been
prepared
to
do
so!
Its
hard
to
hear.
It
could
be
misleading
to
him.
If
I
make
a
contract
Ill
always
work
with
him
to
bring
him
to
the
best
place
he
wants.
In
the
process
he
knows
what
he
sees
and
hears
what
he
knows.
Nothing
is
wrong.
Minerva
gives
off
a
quivering
voice
as
<@203488399061942272>
raises
his
angry
voice.
Echidna
remains
calm
to
the
poor
words
of
those
two.
<@203488399061942272>
also
began
to
feel
a
sense
of
discomfort
due
to
the
cold
sound
of
Echidna.
I
will
examine
Echidnas
words
again
beyond
the
situation
that
I
was
in
the
heat.
Attitude
and
why
the
two
witches
stop.
Whats
wrong?
Im
not
saying
anything
strange.
The
two
witches
admit
that
they
are
not
lying.
If
so
where
is
the
problem?
Lets
repeat
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>.
If
you
choose
me
and
make
a
contract
with
me-I
will
always
take
you
where
you
want.
「――In
the
end
Im
sure
there
will
be
a
pillow
word
huh」
A
sloppy
voice
reaching
out
to
me
and
overlapping
with
Echidnas
words.
You
can
see
that
the
ghost
of
reddish-purple
hair
is
facing
the
face
of
Carmyra
sitting
down
on
the
ground
and
buried
in
his
long
long
hair.
<@203488399061942272>
is
no
longer
surprised
to
see
more
witches.
However
what
<@203488399061942272>
picked
up
was
At
the
end...?
Echidna
uh.
Im
sure
Ill
fulfill
the
contract
uh.
But
just
the
fact
that
Ive
fulfilled
the
contract
uh.
If
you
keep
it
right
the
process
is
ok.
What
can
I
do?
Whatever---
Sekumetos
breathless
words
combined
with
those
feelings
of
incongruity
bring
up
a
hypothesis
in
<@203488399061942272>.
However
the
hypothesis
was
extremely
unacceptable
and
<@203488399061942272>
looked
at
Echidna
who
was
meditating
on
the
attitude
of
the
three
witches
with
his
face
strongly
strengthened.
Echidna
if
you
sign
a
contract...
Ill
be
sure
to
take
me
to
the
best
future
he
said.
Oh
I
told
you.
Its
a
fact.
Im
sure
Ill
fulfill
that
contract.
With
my
knowledge
and
your
traits
I
can
do
it.
Thats
right
its
definitely
a
contract
thats
done
right.
There
is
no
lie
in
Echidnas
words.
If
<@203488399061942272>
cooperates
with
her
she
will
be
able
to
rescue
everything
and
reach
the
future.
However
Your
cooperation
will
lead
me
to
the
best
future-is
it
the
best
way?
「――――」
Do
you
really
give
me
all
the
effort
to
reach
where
I
want?
「――――」
Why
isnt
it?
Answer
me
Echidna...No
the
greedy
witch!
With
his
neck
up
<@203488399061942272>
screams
with
a
hoarse
throat.
Still
being
pulled
down
to
the
ground
the
joints
are
still
in
perfect
condition.
However
without
even
taking
care
of
it
<@203488399061942272>
is
staring
at
Echidna.
And
Echidna
whose
sharp
line
of
sight
was
directed
suddenly
sighed
a
small
breath
If
you
can
reach
the
best
future
you
will
tolerate
the
sacrifice
on
that
path.
I
wonder
if
that
was
your
decision
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>.
-------
It
was
a
reply
that
neither
directly
affirms
nor
denies
<@203488399061942272>s
inquiry.
However
<@203488399061942272>
realizes.
Echidnas
words
today
are
not
about
to
dispel
any
doubts.
On
the
contrary
she
spread
her
arms
to
help
her
understand
Should
be.
I
will
also
do
my
best
to
reach
the
future
you
seek.
And
if
you
can
in
the
process
I
hope
that
you
will
greatly
contribute
to
satisfying
my
curiosity.
Even
if
I
wanted
this
much
the
punishment
would
not
come
true.
You
can
see
the
answer.
I
can
satisfy
my
curiosity.
Mutual
interests
are
the
same.
I
dont
know
the
answer
so
theres
no
way
I
could
deliberately
guide
you
to
the
wrong
option
and
then
have
a
disastrous
consequence.
In
the
sense
that
you
dont
have
the
right
answer
to
the
problem
you
face
from
the
beginning
you
and
I
are
equal.
They
should
both
be
right
comrades
in
the
sense
that
they
both
struggle
with
the
same
problem
struggle
and
struggle
to
give
an
answer.
I
can
make
a
clear
assertion
about
it.
I
am
very
pleased
with
you
in
the
sense
that
there
will
be
more
ways
to
verify
so
I
swear
I
will
never
imitate
you.
Of
course
in
the
face
of
unanswered
questions
its
quite
possible
that
I
wouldnt
be
able
to
easily
overcome
it
even
with
my
cooperation.
Even
if
I
can
help
in
terms
of
knowledge
I
can
never
really
interfere
in
reality.
I
cant
help
you
if
the
obstacles
that
stand
up
are
problems
that
require
physical
and
physical
strength.
Again
and
again
hundreds
or
thousands
you
and
your
body
may
be
broken.
Even
if
that
happens
I
really
want
to
take
care
of
your
heart.
It
cannot
be
asserted
that
there
is
no
feeling
of
inquisitive
mind
that
you
do
not
want
to
lose
your
useful
existence.
However
it
is
true
that
I
like
you
and
want
to
help
you.
So
I
dont
want
you
to
think
its
bad.
Again
Im
proud
of
being
useful
for
your
purposes.
Yes
just
as
I
would
consider
using
your
existence
in
a
sense
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
I
also
want
to
use
my
existence
to
reach
your
best
future.
You
can
use
it
for
in
this
way
As
a
convenient
woman
I
would
like
to
be
treated
by
you.
If
that
makes
you
motivated
then
I
will
gladly
offer
my
existence.
Apart
from
whether
you
want
this
poor
and
already
dead
body.
Oops
is
it
bad
for
your
mind
to
say
such
a
thing?
Your
thoughts-silver
half-elf
and
blue-haired
demon
girl.
Yes
the
girls
who
show
their
vows
in
their
hearts
to
help
you
and
to
protect
you.
My
thoughts
on
your
hearts
emotional
feelings
towards
them
are
not
to
be
stated
here
but
the
height
of
the
wall
that
stands
in
front
of
you
is
unimaginable.
Lets
affirm.
At
present
how
many
things
that
are
out
of
your
control
due
to
known
obstacles
are
scattered.
Your
preparedness
to
overcome
them
alone
is
precious
and
too
sad.
There
is
no
lie
in
the
feeling
that
I
want
to
become
a
force
on
your
path
and
wish
you
could.
And
you
should
take
advantage
of
my
feelings.
You
have
to
help
all
who
you
have
all
that
you
have
available
and
those
who
do
all
that
to
form
a
bond.
Its
an
oath
youve
sworn
to
yourself
a
belief
that
youve
divulged
on
the
road
to
pain
as
it
is
necessary.
So
Ill
ask
you
layer
on
you
think
of
you.
Ironically
the
way
you
walked
with
your
life
throwing
away
your
life
was
now
ironically
proved
in
the
form
of
a
second
trial.
Or
even
that
trial
seems
necessary
enough
to
even
make
you
illusion
that
it
was
there
to
help
you
understand
the
path
youve
been
taking.
Its
true
that
it
was
a
kind
of
spectacle
that
was
unnecessarily
necessary
and
that
the
mind
was
worn
out.
But
if
I
knew
or
didnt
know
I
would
respect
the
latter
no
matter
what
tragic
fact.
You
have
and
will
need
to
offer
your
life
for
the
return
to
death
and
pull
in
the
future.
The
sacrifice
for
that
is
in
this
way
the
worlds
It
was
necessary
to
keep
in
mind
that
maybe.
Eventually
I
will
not
be
sentimental
about
paying
my
life
my
human
emotions
will
be
diluted
I
will
not
move
even
to
the
death
of
my
important
people
I
will
be
emotionless
emotionless
and
lethargic
Even
if
it
sinks
and
reaches
the
best
future
it
will
reach
you
in
the
absence
of
you-it
was
necessary
in
order
not
to
reach
a
future
where
only
a
feeling
of
wasted
remains.
Yes
theres
nothing
wasted
on
everything
in
the
world
its
all
the
roads
you
need
the
pieces
you
need.
There
was
a
trial
to
understand
it.
If
you
need
to
give
a
plausible
meaning
to
the
cause
of
your
reason
for
stopping
and
think
about
it
think
like
this.
And
I
affirm
your
idea.
Give
me
the
power
you
need
to
move
forward
in
whatever
words
I
can
give
you.
Whether
its
comforting
blasting
whispering
love
or
aggravating
hatred
if
it
helps
you
I
can
use
it
without
hesitation.
You
may
be
reluctant
to
do
that
but
your
future
will
always
require
the
power
of
being
like
me.
If
you
are
going
on
a
path
of
loneliness
that
is
inevitable
to
hurt
you
must
be
able
to
walk
along
that
path
without
turning
your
eyes.
And
if
that
role
is
me
then
no
one
else
can
walk
with
me
without
any
problems.
Lets
repeat
repeat
tell
you
to
reach
you
again
and
again.
--You
must
have
me.
And
I
need
you.
I
need
your
existence.
My
curiosity
can
no
longer
be
fulfilled
without
you.
Only
you
exist
to
satisfy
me.
It
will
surely
give
me
satisfaction
in
my
greed
that
is
never
satisfied.
Your
existence
is
no
longer
indispensable
to
me
who
lives
in
this
closed
world.
If
you
want
to
be
someones
hope
and
use
your
power
to
open
up
the
world
Is
it
possible
to
get
angry?
I
will
not
hesitate
to
offer
this
body
knowledge
soul
if
you
give
me
that
warmth.
So
please.
I
want
you
to
believe
me.
Thus
the
reason
I
didnt
try
to
convey
my
true
intentions
was
not
to
try
to
deceive
you
or
try
to
hide.
It
was
just
a
matter
of
timing.
If
you
were
calling
for
a
piece
of
your
heart
at
this
moment
you
must
have
left
me.
Thats
an
unbearable
loss
for
me.
Of
course
it
should
be
a
loss
to
you
in
the
sense
of
moving
away
from
the
desired
future.
Due
to
the
characteristic
of
return
to
death
you
will
surely
reach
the
future
you
want.
But
for
the
future
you
can
reach
the
less
you
pay
the
better.
I
can
alleviate
it.
Dont
get
me
wrong
I
think
its
a
human-made
idea
that
despises
a
small
purpose
because
of
a
large
purpose
such
as
that
you
can
finally
reach
the
desired
result.
Sure
enough
Im
tempted
to
see
the
consequences
of
these
cases
so
Im
confident
Ill
never
do
something
like
that
while
being
aware
of
the
elements
needed
to
do
my
best
but
never
saying
it.
I
cant
control
my
desires.
Let
me
admit
that.
But
I
dont
fool
you.
If
there
is
something
to
do
with
such
a
distrustful
act
I
will
never
simply
hide
it.
Be
sure
to
confide.
And
Ill
do
my
best
to
help
you
in
regaining
the
lost
trust.
Whatever
happens
Ill
send
you
to
the
best
future
you
want.
Absolutely
absolutely.
So
why
dont
you
choose
me
as
a
necessary
means
for
that?
I
wanted
you
and
the
demands
you
asked
for
were
as
stated
in
the
contract.
The
rest
of
the
story
is
about
how
far
you
can
go
about
your
wishes.
Im
ready
to
go.
After
that
I
want
to
hear
your
readiness.
You
are
the
contract
with
me
I
would
like
to
prove
to
you
that
I
have
the
will
to
make
sure
that
I
will
reach
the
future
without
fail
with
the
cooperation
of
me.
Only
then
can
you
be
proud
to
say
that
you
have
overcome
the
second
trial.
Proceed
to
the
third
trial
and
overcome
it
to
release
the
sanctuary.
This
is
the
right
trial
that
must
be
overcome
considering
the
disaster
that
will
come
to
the
sanctuary
your
thoughts
and
your
loved
ones.
Tell
me
that
you
have
the
power
to
overcome
it.
Then
take
me
away
take
advantage
of
my
knowledge
and
obtain
what
lies
ahead.
Thats
all
I
can
ask
you
ask
you
and
offer
you
instead.
Im
seriously
and
honestly
confident
in
everything.
Then
what
kind
of
judgment
do
you
make?
Tell
me
about
that.
To
fill
my
curiosity
with
my
existence
--Echidna
then
smiled
cutely.
He
shakes
his
white
snow-like
hair
his
cheeks
blush
with
a
passion
and
waits
for
<@203488399061942272>s
answer.
The
quivering
eyelashes
were
frightened
by
the
reaction
and
the
fingertips
on
the
chest
seemed
to
move
because
of
anxiety.
Many
times
the
lips
were
hesitant
in
trying
to
spell
the
word
only
moistening
it
with
the
tip
of
the
tongue.
Look
up.
I
met
Minerva
who
is
holding
<@203488399061942272>.
Minerva
makes
a
small
sigh
when
he
looks
at
<@203488399061942272>.
Then
he
releases
<@203488399061942272>s
arm
which
he
had
not
tried
to
release
until
then.
The
shoulder
restraint
was
released
and
he
became
free
turning
his
arm
and
<@203488399061942272>
stood
up.
As
Minerva
says
the
squeezing
of
the
shoulders
has
been
resolved.
On
the
contrary
I
felt
that
I
was
missing
the
fatigue
of
the
waist
and
other
parts
that
were
lightly
stretched.
The
power
of
wrath
of
wrath
the
terrifying
healing
effect.
「――――」
<@203488399061942272>
arranges
his
head
while
turning
various
parts
of
his
body
and
checking
his
feelings.
The
true
intention
of
Echidna
which
has
just
been
heard
and
is
not
hidden.
Echidna
What?
You...
do
you
use
me?
To
be
used.
It
is
the
word
of
Echidna
that
has
been
repeated
many
times.
In
response
Echidna
nods
without
hesitation.
Yes
you
should
do
that
too.
The
contract
is
a
precautionary
line
to
keep
you
on
the
same
track.
I
blame
you
for
using
whatever
you
can
to
keep
your
existence.
If
so
be
patient
and
accept
it.
I
didnt
think
about
it.
I
know
in
extreme
terms
thats
what
interests
are
all
about.
Youre
hundred
percent
you
know
that
you
can
help
me
with
good
intentions...
Im
expecting
it
but
its
not.
Im
ready
to
accept
reality.
In
front
of
Echidna
<@203488399061942272>
turned
his
face
up
with
his
palm.
No
matter
how
much
it
is...
What
is
that?
Everything
you
did
so
far
looks
faint
to
me
now.
Everything
youve
ever
treated
me
favorably
is
what
makes
me
bad
about
you.
I
felt
like
I
was
beginning
to
trust
it...
From
the
first
meeting
the
things
that
have
been
accumulated
until
this
moment
make
a
noise
and
collapse.
A
tea
party
for
encounters
scenes
of
trials
and
the
time
when
she
was
often
caught
up
in
her
wisdom
and
obstructed
by
reality.
The
time
when
I
tried
to
make
a
contract
and
I
didnt
regret
it.
--All
of
them
mercilessly
mock
the
foolishness
of
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>.
Is
that
what
you
intended
from
the
beginning?
Im
not
sure
what
youre
having
a
problem
with.
If
youre
going
to
get
the
best
out
of
it
youll
be
on
your
way
to
it-yes
you
decided?
You
affirm
it.
Well
I
should
have
pushed
my
back
too...
So
Im
divisible...Im
not
divisible
but
I
think
it
wasnt
what
you
intended
that
made
you
move
in
that
direction.
Dont
get
me
wrong
your
conclusion
is
just
yours.
What
I
did
is
just
a
small
boost
to
your
conclusions.
Im
not
impressed
by
someone
else
to
take
responsibility
for
it.
Im
not
impressed
and
Im
not
so
friendly
as
to
accept
it.
Echidna
defends
her
lips
with
a
sharp-looking
face.
<@203488399061942272>
feels
more
uncomfortable
than
ever
because
of
the
childhood
of
emotional
expression
or
the
out
of
place.
What
should
it
be?-Its
a
fragile
feeling.
Echidnas
emotional
expression
is
not
wrong.
Resentful
when
suspected
smiled
when
happy
and
made
sad
look
in
sadness.
Thats
right
not
wrong.
It
should
be
that
but
I
feel
a
sense
of
discomfort
and
a
sense
of
distrust.
The
answer
is...
Everything
you
do
is
insane
and
innocent.
「――――」
To
rejoice
even
when
you
get
angry
your
emotional
expression
is
childish
and
flimsy.
Even
now
Im
just
frustrated
and
Ive
just
had
a
sly
face.
Its
not
a
big
problem
or
something
like
that.
Your
attitude
is...
…The
attitude
so
far
is
weird.
I
thought
you
were
such
a
light-hearted
and
easy-to-accept
guy
that
you
could
easily
associate
with...”
「――――」
Actually
different.
You-you
are
the
guy
who
cant
understand
the
emotions
of
others.
Echidnas
past
behavior
is
remembered
and
everything
becomes
sepia.
When
I
felt
that
each
of
the
attitudes
I
thought
to
be
favorable
was
the
result
of
flimsy
emotional
expression
I
felt
that
all
of
my
past
contacts
had
faded.
And
despite
being
exposed
to
such
harsh
words
Echidnas
facial
expression
is
the
same
as
the
one
he
used
to
talk
about.
Dont
know
any
more
emotional
expressions
of
discomfort.
This
is
another
scene
where
you
can
get
angry.
...Well
should
I
be
screaming
and
shouting
here?
I
see
I
learned.
If
I
had
the
next
opportunity
would
I
do
it?
In
<@203488399061942272>s
words
the
expression
disappeared
from
Echidna.
Expressionless-it
was
the
first
greedy
witch
that
<@203488399061942272>
who
knew
of
Echidna
had
never
seen
before.
In
front
of
the
silent
<@203488399061942272>
Echidna
rings
the
finger.
Then
the
hill
that
was
supposed
to
be
destroyed
is
restored
and
the
shattered
table
is
reshaped
into
a
blown
chair.
Echidna
sat
on
one
of
the
chairs
and
pointed
her
hand
at
the
facing
chair
Why
dont
you
sit
down?
Id
like
to
have
a
fine
agreement
on
the
contract.
...In
this
situation
do
you
think
Im
still
positive
about
the
deal
with
you?
No
way
if
you
reject
me
with
a
little
bit
of
disagreement
whats
the
point
of
doing
that?
Its
not
wise
to
lose
sight
of
the
right
choice
overwhelmed
by
temporary
emotions.
I
recommend
looking
at
the
reality
and
choosing
rational
ideas.
Equidnas
chilled
emotions
make
<@203488399061942272>
meditate
and
hold
her
breath.
Echidnas
words
are
correct.
It
is
unavoidable
to
be
told
that
<@203488399061942272>
has
a
tantrum.
It
makes
sense.
There
are
no
lies.
Echidna
was
just
hiding
his
true
intentions
in
<@203488399061942272>.
I
just
kept
quiet
about
<@203488399061942272>s
journey
and
my
own
profits
in
the
process.
With
a
contract
<@203488399061942272>
will
probably
be
on
the
right
path.
It
must
be
true
that
Echidna
spares
no
effort
in
its
cooperation.
There
was
one
thing
I
wanted
to
ask
if
I
could
meet
you.
--Hmm
what
is
it?
If
I
hear
the
answer
I
feel
like
I
can
choose.
Echidna
is
waiting
for
<@203488399061942272>s
question.
<@203488399061942272>
raises
a
question
as
a
touchstone
to
her.
It
is
one
of
the
answers
that
<@203488399061942272>
has
yet
to
find
a
piece
of
answer
in
the
loop
starting
from
this
sanctuary
and
is
a
question
that
is
never
related
to
her.
-I
dont
know
Beatrice
Echidna
...Oh
I
know.
Im
deeply
involved
in
the
process
of
his
birth.
Whats
wrong
with
that
child?
Echidnas
innocent
reply.
It
is
a
questionable
answer
with
no
implications.
<@203488399061942272>
closes
his
eyes
and
envisions
a
young
girl
with
a
vertical
roll
on
her
mind.
For
<@203488399061942272>
the
last
appearance
of
the
girl
is
the
moment
when
it
penetrates
from
behind
and
disappears.
Immediately
before
that
when
I
was
hit
by
the
darkness
that
came
out
of
her
long
and
lonely
time
I
had
a
heavy
lump
in
my
heart.
The
expression
that
floated
<@203488399061942272>
away
protected
from
the
bad
edge
and
floated
at
the
last
moment-it
still
burns
in
my
eyes
and
I
cant
leave.
So
Beatrice
is
a
contract
and
has
been
waiting
for
the
person
to
come.
Is
the
contract
tied
to
you?
Are
you
binding
him
to
the
mansion?
I
dont
remember
specifying
the
location...Im
sure
I
promised
to
protect
the
book
store
and
wait
until
the
arrival.
If
so
who
is
that
person?
How
can
I
release
him?
In
the
loneliness
of
400
years
Beatrice
has
been
waiting
for
the
existence
of
someone.
Beatrice
himself
does
not
know
who
that
someone
was.
I
cant
even
find
a
clue
on
<@203488399061942272>.
However
if
Echidna
himself
hears
the
answer
she
has
made
a
promise
with
that
someone.
Who
is
it?
-What
is
that?
No
Im
not
kidding
I
think
so.
I
wonder
who
the
person
Beatrice
is
waiting
for.
Echidna
responds
to
<@203488399061942272>
as
if
he
had
been
asked
a
question
he
didnt
know
the
answer
to.
That
attitude
made
<@203488399061942272>
stunned
then
shook
his
head
You
dont
even
know
who
the
Beatrice
waiter
is?
Yeah
I
dont
know.
Beatrice
waits
I
dont
know
who
the
person
is.
Why?
Wait
for
Beatrice
in
the
banned
library
you
said
that?
You
dont
know...
no
way.
Is
Echidna
instructing
Beatrice
to
wait
in
the
book
store
and
is
it
another
person
who
set
the
deadline
until
the
person
visits?
If
so
another
person
knows
the
answer.
No
thats
a
mistake.
「――――」
Im
telling
Beatrice
to
wait
for
the
person.
Thats
not
wrong.
Whats
wrong
is
more
fundamental.
Fundamental?
Im
wondering
why
for
whatever
reason
I
signed
Beatrice
such
a
contract.
I
think
thats
what
Beatrice
is
protecting.
I
dont
understand
the
meaning
of
Echidnas
words.
Thats
a
natural
idea.
Tell
someone
to
give
me
something.
Of
course
it
is
decided
that
the
handing
over
is
to
be
done.
However
Echidna
shook
her
head
and
said
to
<@203488399061942272>
who
had
such
a
natural
idea.
Im
not
telling
Beatrice
I
made
a
contract
with
him
to
wait
for
that
person...waiting
for
the
result
of
who
she
chose
that
person.
Im
here.
「――――」
----.
――――――.
――――――――――――.
--------------------What?
That
child
was
born
for
a
certain
purpose.
But
I
needed
to
make
use
of
it
in
a
way
that
was
different
from
its
original
purpose...
For
that
reason
I
was
moved
away
from
here
but
at
that
time
I
needed
to
give
it
a
purpose
and
also
to
give
that
empty
child
a
purpose
to
live
so
I
made
a
contract
with
him.
--that
is
Maintaining
a
library
and
transferring
everything
to
the
person
that
will
come.
There
was
no
limit.
Originally
there
was
no
correct
answer.
That
child
was
kept
alive
as
planned
and
I
was
that.
You
can
see
the
answer
to
another
inquiry
isnt
it
so
rational?
「――――」
Of
course
one
of
the
consequences
is
that
I
have
spent
400
years
without
choosing.
It
is
also
true
that
among
the
people
I
met
in
my
day
I
did
not
easily
choose
that
person.
Its
one
of
the
consequences
of
worried
about
whether
or
not
I
want
to
die.
What
do
you
think
of
that?
-?
Do
you
think
its
wonderful?
Echidna
tilts
her
head
as
if
she
had
heard
the
obvious.
The
answer
the
attitude
and
the
expression
of
the
girl
in
<@203488399061942272>s
mind
gave
the
answer.
decided.
all
right.
Clearly
understood.
-I
was
able
to
correct
the
misunderstanding
of
where
this
was
and
who
the
other
person
was.
Echidna...you
are
a
witch
「――――」
Its
a
monster
that
is
incomprehensible
incomprehensible
「――――」
Tell.
The
answer
that
came
out
in
my
heart.
This
time
he
decides
who
to
withdraw
his
hand
and
reach
out
to.
I...I
cant
take
your
hand.
Ive
decided
on
a
hand.
「――――」
Someone
is
innocent
has
no
malice
and
has
tied
up
words
for
400
years.-I
decided.
Ill
take
that
hand.
I
cant
go
with
you.
Announce
the
farewell.
Shake
off
the
hand
of
the
person
who
thought
that
he
could
walk
together
at
once.
I
raised
my
face.
I
looked
forward.
On
the
back
of
<@203488399061942272>s
eyelid
the
expression
of
the
girl
at
the
last
moment
was
floating.
--A
girl
who
was
relieved
with
her
relief
in
her
eyes
fearing
disappearing
and
dying
distorting
her
face
so
that
she
could
cry
and
still
protecting
<@203488399061942272>.
<@203488399061942272>
decided
to
take
the
hand
of
the
girl
who
mourned
<@203488399061942272>s
death.
「――――」
Echidna
narrows
her
eyes.
For
some
reason
I
think
Im
going
to
cast
a
word
on
<@203488399061942272>s
decision
and
my
thoughts
run
through
the
twin
circles.
But
before
that
change
came.
「――――
came
here」
No
I
dont...
I
dont
care...
I
see.
The
troublesome
place
the
troublesome
guy
came
to
the
trouble
huh.
The
three
witches
on
the
sidelines
express
their
emotions.
And
a
feeling
of
pressure
behind.
From
the
front
Echidnas
eyes
looking
behind
<@203488399061942272>
are
lightly
opened.
<@203488399061942272>
followed
her
surprise
turned
around
and
saw
it.
「――――」
There
was
a
witch
of
jealousy
with
her
head
covered
in
dark
black.

≠
Satella
--In
this
way
it
was
the
first
time
for
<@203488399061942272>
to
meet
the
witch
himself.
Ive
heard
the
name
of
a
jealous
witch
many
times
and
Ive
been
confronted
with
the
witchs
threat
itself
in
a
loop
starting
from
this
sanctuary.
I
never
felt
the
pain
of
squeezing
my
heart
by
violating
the
rules
that
I
was
forced
to
do
not
once
or
twice
but
I
got
a
good
impression
of
the
witch
who
took
over
the
body
of
Emilia
and
destroyed
the
sanctuary
Is
more
difficult.
This
is
even
more
true
now
that
the
word
witch
has
created
an
aversion
in
the
last
conversation
with
Echidna.
However
After
all
this
guy
is...
different
from
other
witches.
<@203488399061942272>
murmured
with
a
screaming
voice
in
front
of
the
pressure
from
the
witch
standing
in
front
of
her.
A
slender
woman.
It
seems
that
you
are
looking
at
me
in
a
standing
position
with
both
hands
lowered
without
any
effort.
Its
body
was
dressed
in
a
jet-black
dress-literally
dressed
in
a
shadow
rising
from
the
bottom
of
its
feet
and
it
was
found
to
rippling
its
skin
as
if
to
match
the
heartbeat.
Although
it
is
a
dress
with
long
sleeves
strange
white
fingers
can
be
seen
from
the
wrist
and
it
can
be
predicted
that
like
other
witches
the
Jealousy
Witch
will
also
have
a
good
look.
However
it
lacks
the
most
necessary
information
to
determine
that.
I
have
seen
it
several
times...what
is
that
principle?
The
area
above
the
witchs
neck
cannot
be
seen
because
it
is
covered
with
a
jet
black
shadow.
Unlike
the
jet-black
dress
worn
in
the
body
the
shadow
flutters
like
a
fog
but
hides
the
appearance
of
Jealous
witch
from
<@203488399061942272>.
The
question
of
<@203488399061942272>
is
frightened
but
there
is
no
reaction
from
the
witch.
<@203488399061942272>
who
sweated
on
his
forehead
glanced
at
the
frustration
that
was
growing
in
his
heart
glanced
at
the
surroundings-observing
the
other
four
witches
in
silence.
「――――」
<@203488399061942272>
feels
something
strange
when
he
sees
their
facial
expressions
change.
As
far
as
<@203488399061942272>
knows
the
relationship
between
Jealous
witch
and
theirs
is
a
perpetrator
and
victim
of
murder.
The
one
who
killed
me-subaru
knows
at
least
what
kind
of
mental
strain
it
would
take
to
meet
him
again.
However
the
facial
expressions
of
the
witches
were
different
from
<@203488399061942272>s
imagination.
One
is
a
soft
smile
one
is
a
compassionate
pity
one
is
the
indifference
of
indifference
itself
and
one
is
the
last.
Did
you
break
into
the
boundaries
of
me
and
step
into
the
dream
castle
innocently...its
all
about
you.
Only
one
person
Echidna
staring
at
the
Jealous
witch
has
hostility
in
her
eyes.
It
was
surprising
to
<@203488399061942272>
that
Echidna
who
was
similar
to
hatred
had
no
one
else
on
it.
I
just
thought
of
her
as
having
no
such
feelings
and
just
said
goodbye.
I
suspect
that
<@203488399061942272>
was
erroneously
thinking
that
she
was
showing
her
emotions.
However
as
a
practical
matter
the
situation
of
listing
them
has
already
passed.
Now
the
problem
is
how
to
deal
with
the
witch
in
front
of
me
who
is
still
moving.
In
the
first
place
what
did
you
mean
when
he
was
here...
Dont
you
make
me
angry
because
Im
flirting
about
things
I
cant
talk
to?
I
wonder
if
Im
a
man
with
such
a
light
mouth.
I
know
a
little
bit
the
resentment
of
that
child.
I
dont
know
what
you
mean.
Do
you
have
that
witchs
shoulder?
From
the
perspective
of
you
and
other
witches
isnt
he
your
own?
Your
humor
sounds
like
ridiculous
words...
Ill
see
if
youre
right.
Minerva
moves
by
squinting
the
wavy
blond
hair
squinting
at
<@203488399061942272>s
words.
She
looked
at
<@203488399061942272>
with
all
her
might
and
when
she
interrupted
her
line
of
sight
with
the
witch
of
jealousy
she
proudly
confronted
her
with
her
rich
chest.
And
Can
you
hear
me
Minerva.
Minerva
in
The
Witch
of
Rage.
If
you
remember
or
hear
your
voice
properly
reply.
-!
No
wait!
As
far
as
I
know
I
cant
communicate
with
him!
If
I
stimulated
with
more
strange
actions...
I
hope
you
keep
silent
huh.
Minerva
speaks
with
his
mouth
which
only
looks
reckless
to
<@203488399061942272>s
eyes.
However
<@203488399061942272>s
words
trying
to
stop
it
are
blocked
by
Sekumet
who
is
still
a
pill
on
the
ground
behind
him.
As
<@203488399061942272>
turns
around
with
just
a
glance
Sekumet
is
changing
the
size
of
the
red-purple
hairball
Many
times
as
much
as
the
short
time
you
touched
me
uh.
I
used
to
spend
time
with
that
huh.
Its
a
matter
of
course
that
Im
worried
uh.
Lets
leave
it
to
Minerva.
Well
even
that
child
can
move
without
thinking...
Well
uh.
Well
I
dont
think
I
think
so
this
time
huh.
I
can
hear
you
Sekumeto!
If
I
didnt
want
to
talk
to
you
because
I
failed
to
talk
dont
say
anything
that
makes
me
angry!
Ill
poke
you
into
the
angry
hair!
People
just
breathe
in
front
of
me
uh.
When
you
get
angry
when
you
find
a
reason
to
get
angry
huh.
What
are
you
talking
about
eh?
Despite
being
euphoric
Minerva
is
not
conscious
of
the
threat
in
front
of
him.
The
Jealous
Witch
should
have
been
able
to
take
any
action
during
the
current
exchange
but
he
just
stands
still
and
does
nothing
but
stare
at
<@203488399061942272>
through
the
Witch
of
Fury.
To
be
sure
it
may
be
said
that
it
is
different
from
the
real-life
witchs
response
up
to
now.
However
it
seems
that
it
is
different
from
whether
it
is
in
a
position
to
establish
a
conversation
just
because
it
does
not
immediately
act
in
a
hostile
action.
Minerva
is
in
charge
of
dialogue
and
Sekmet
has
full
authority
over
such
Minerva.
Then
what
about
the
two
remaining
people?
But...
Minerva-chan
is
doing
my
best...
If
I
can
Im
okay...
but
Its
a
dependable
statement
but
Im
sure
youve
repeatedly
said
that
it
doesnt
go
along
well
with
You.
Only
Sekumet
can
fight
it.-You
know?
Echidna
strives
to
lick
Carmila
who
is
rebellious
but
rebellious
while
calming
her
voice.
Then
when
the
white-haired
witch
looked
at
Sekumet
on
her
side
the
hairball
shook
the
whole
thing
saying
that
even
she
could
reply
I
dont
think
its
possible
to
keep
the
movements
under
control
hmm.
You
know
that
its
not
suitable
for
that
kind
of
thing
because
of
your
ability.
I
know.
So
you
just
have
to
crush
your
limbs
and
screw
your
neck.
You
can
physically
stop
your
movements
and
stop
your
breath
and
I
can
bury
yourself
from
this
space.
Echidna
is
so
hostile
that
Carmilas
remarks
look
so
cute.
Its
an
easy-going
narrative
but
I
dont
think
its
a
joke
because
there
is
an
abhorrence
of
disgust
at
the
end
of
each
word.
Anyway
just
for
Jealous
Witch
I
cant
believe
that
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
the
negative
thoughts
of
Echidna.
Minervas
confrontation
with
the
witch
of
jealousy
continues
with
such
a
quick-on-the-go
conversation
going
on
behind
him.
On
the
contrary
Minerva
took
steps
one
step
further
as
if
he
didnt
want
the
witch
of
jealousy
to
hear
the
conversations
of
the
other
witches.
「――――」
Without
a
voice
<@203488399061942272>
breathes
while
watching
Minervas
progress.
Minervas
actions
seem
reckless
to
<@203488399061942272>
but
I
cant
even
see
what
the
Jealous
Witch
appeared
to
do
here.
Consistent
with
the
situation
so
far
the
reason
why
the
witch
appeared
was
because
<@203488399061942272>
broke
the
contraindications.
However
the
only
thing
the
witch
has
done
for
<@203488399061942272>
who
has
broken
the
contraindications
is
to
expose
only
his
arms
and
hurt
his
heart.When
he
appears
in
reality
and
interferes
what
he
sees
is
what
he
sees.
I
was
just
swallowing
the
shadow
from
one
end.
Not
to
mention
friendly
contact
on
the
contrary
the
witch
of
jealousy
has
never
even
expressed
her
intention.
I
dont
know
the
fragments
of
the
witchs
prospects
now
and
in
the
past.
So
what
kind
of
action
the
witch
would
take
on
Minerva
was
an
unknown
quantity
for
<@203488399061942272>.
--If
Minerva
was
swallowed
in
the
shadow
the
three
people
behind
would
move
immediately.
If
the
expectations
put
on
by
Sekumet
are
certain
The
Lazy
Witch
will
crush
the
Jealous
Witch
with
authority
and
Echidna
will
be
able
to
drive
it
away
if
it
is
the
weakened
Jealous
Witch.
But
then-
It
was
no
wonder
to
<@203488399061942272>
why
he
didnt
do
it
right
now.
「――――」
Speaking
of
strangeness
it
is
already
strange
that
Minerva
is
left
to
the
initial
contact
with
the
Jealous
witch.
Carmila
who
does
not
stop
fighting
if
his
hand
is
put
out
still
does
not
want
active
hostility
and
even
Echidna
who
is
full
of
enthusiasm
hastened
to
strike
the
first
strike
even
against
Minervas
intentions.
I
havent.
What
on
earth
are
they
aiming
at?
I
cant
see
the
witches
thoughts
and
they
look
like
they
are
being
tossed.
.........
But
I...Oops
its
because
its
a
witchs
name
that
I
think
its
easy
to
see
the
inside
of
us.
I
dont
think
its
cheap.
I
dont
think
Im
the
one
who
got
it.-If
you
really
want
to
keep
the
Jealous
Witch
away
Im
just
wondering
if
defenseless
now
is
the
best
aim.
I
see.
You
see
the
situation
right
now.
Thats...
yeah
I
see.
I
of
course
raise
your
hand
to
your
point
and
I
agree.
In
the
original
case
I
myself
have
all
the
powers
I
can
have.
Id
like
to
slam
it
and
let
it
disappear
without
leaving
any
fragments...
Then
cut
the
words
and
Echidna
squints.
That
attitude
doesnt
seem
like
shes--I
dont
know
how
much
she
knew
about
her
now
but
<@203488399061942272>
waits
for
a
word
feeling
something
that
isnt
like
her.
After
a
little
silence
Echidna
then
said.
If
you
try
to
get
rid
of
that
and
then
be
targeted
by
other
witches
its
a
bad
fall.
Its
a
bad
idea
to
put
a
bet
on
Semmet
and
Tuffon
aside
from
Minerva.
Its
a
thing.
I
cant
see
the
story.
Why
if
you
try
to
eliminate
the
Jealous
Witch
theyll
turn
into
enemies.
In
my
sense
its
the
same
for
everyone...
Chi
............?
It
was
Carmira
who
kept
silence
so
far
that
interrupted
<@203488399061942272>s
question.
She
didnt
look
at
<@203488399061942272>
with
a
drowsiness
and
kept
staring
at
the
confrontation
between
Minerva
and
the
witch
of
jealousy
For
me
Jealousy
is
a
jealousy
isnt
it...
but
its
a
different
story
from
that
girl?
...I
dont
understand
what
youre
saying.
What
are
you
guys
doing...
I
dont
know
which
one
is
here
uh.
Its
not
a
misunderstanding
before
Im
reluctant
to
get
out
of
this
huh.
Which
one...?
Sekumets
answer
that
took
over
the
words.
However
even
that
has
only
implications
for
confusion
for
<@203488399061942272>.
The
understanding
of
what
they
were
saying
came
from
another
angle.
One
step
further
Minerva
shortens
the
distance
from
Jealous
witch.
She
then
spread
her
hands
to
create
a
non-resisting
stance
and
said
to
the
Jealousy
Witch.
-
Are
you
a
witch
of
jealousy
or
Satella?
Which?
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
<@203488399061942272>
felt
that
there
was
a
statement
that
completely
undermined
his
recognition.
Minervas
words
are
very
different
from
what
<@203488399061942272>
knows.
However
the
fact
that
it
was
neither
Minervas
delusion
nor
a
kind
of
joke
was
affirmed
by
the
silence
of
the
witches
who
lived
in
the
same
period.
For
the
first
time
Minervas
call
shook
the
shoulder
of
Jealousian
Witch.
A
black
haze
covered
his
head
and
his
body
seemed
to
face
Minerva.
-The
witch
put
Minerva
into
her
consciousness
for
the
first
time
at
this
moment.
「――――」
<@203488399061942272>
wasnt
given
the
gap
to
ask
what
he
was
saying.
More
than
that
it
is
quicker
to
feel
thirsty
and
tense.
Even
with
the
affirmation
of
the
witches
it
was
a
betrayal
of
<@203488399061942272>s
ideas
from
far
above.
Minerva
says
--Satella
the
“witch
of
jealousy”.
The
person
called
that
way
may
be
another
person.
No
I
think
too
much
under
the
present
conditions.
How
many
times
have
you
been
hurt
by
the
stereotypes
judging
only
by
the
information
on
the
top?
Dont
stick
to
it
even
if
you
always
consider
it.
Above
all
you
shouldnt
be
distracted
by
a
second
from
the
sight
in
front
of
you.
The
first
question
is
that
you
dont
suddenly
ask...
there
are
still
opportunities.
While
saying
Minerva
gets
closer.
There
are
only
five
steps
between
the
witch
of
fury
and
the
witch.
In
the
case
of
The
Jealousy
Witch
it
wouldnt
be
strange
if
I
suddenly
turned
to
Jealousy
when
I
stood
between
those
children
but
I
wasnt
worried
about
that
much.
Four
more
steps.
But
then
I
wish
I
could
speak
to
you
first
and
I
know
that
its
a
relationship
that
makes
it
difficult
for
me
to
meet
face
to
face.
At
that
time
when
I
swallowed
me
the
last
face
I
remember
Its
not
that.
Three
Steps.
I
think
Im
better
than
the
other
five
but
I
think
Im
the
best
friend
aside
from
Tufon
but
otherwise...
two
steps.
Look
down.
Yeah
I
was
thinking...
but
I
was
thinking
so...
Crouched
Two
more
steps
away
Minerva
leans
forward
and
builds
strength
in
his
hind
legs.
And
In
this
situation
its
been
a
while
since
I
was
able
to
understand
the
feeling
of
being
ignored-!?
The
ground
explodes
and
disappears
with
just
one
step
a
distance
of
only
two
steps.
Minerva
who
rushed
up
with
dust
and
twisted
twisted
his
body
greatly
and
fired
a
fist
with
full
body
spirit
from
his
shoulder.
It
pierces
the
atmosphere
breaks
through
the
speed
barrier
and
roars
to
the
witchs
head.
I
rushed
to
my
face
covered
in
darkness
--See
what
you
expected
Minervas
fist
miraculously
stopped
just
before
hitting
the
witchs
face
directly.
It
doesnt
mean
that
the
witchs
shadow
stretched
and
caught
her
arm.
With
Minervas
will
his
arm
stopped
just
before
it
stretched
out.
Minerva
puts
his
upper
body
back
and
shakes
his
blond
hair
with
his
fist-clad
posture.
Look
at
it.
Its
Satella
who
knows
I
dont
have
to
fend
off
my
fist
not
the
jealous
witch.
Echidna
you
dont
need
to
be
alert.
...
I
dont
know.
I
admire
your
willingness
to
prove
yourself
but
apart
from
this
purely
underestimated
the
threat
of
your
being.
Its
natural
but
that
doesnt
work
so
Sekumet.
Im
not
trying
to
move
me
for
any
reason
eh.
You
have
the
same
bad
life
Echidna
eh.
I
admit
thats
Satera
huh.
Sekumet
only
sighs
at
Echidna
who
closes.
The
witches
final
weapons
which
are
still
fluffy
have
no
sign
of
movement.
And
Minerva
who
confronts
the
witch-Satella
at
a
touch-to-hand
distance
looked
back
at
<@203488399061942272>.
Staring
in
a
blue
eye
<@203488399061942272>
has
no
choice
but
to
stand
still
unaware
of
the
reality
of
her
immediate
threat.
When
Minerva
looks
dissatisfied
with
such
<@203488399061942272>s
attitude
What
are
you
fussy
about?
Please
come
here
soon.
Come
on...yes
even
if
you
tell
me
What
you
dont
look
like
a
boy.
You
proved
yourself
that
Im
okay
so
you
shouldnt
you
come
here
dignifiedly?
Isnt
that
it?
If
someone
asks
you
to
hit
Ishibashi
and
you
cant
cross
how
can
you
cross
it?
Dont
get
excited
and
heat
up!
Bibi
cant
go
there!
I
cant
go
there
because
I
dont
know
why!
In
a
similar
voice
to
Minervas
resentment
<@203488399061942272>
challenges
the
situation
of
being
left
behind.
Stepping
on
and
pointing
at
Satella
which
seems
to
be
out
of
the
immediacy
of
threats
<@203488399061942272>
looks
around
at
the
witches
who
are
unwinding
What
does
it
mean
when
Satella
separates
from
the
jealous
witch
in
the
first
place?
You
used
to
say
that
but
I
was
already
different
in
knowledge!
There
is
no
such
thing.
If
such
an
unsuitable
entity
forcibly
takes
in
a
witch
factor
such
a
harmful
effect
will
also
occur.
What
should
be
called
a
witch
personality
caused
by
the
influence
of
the
factor
and
the
original
confrontation
with
myself
...?
Its
the
same
thing
for
me
so
I
dont
really
like
what
it
means
to
distinguish
them.
Other
personality...!
Whats
wrong?
One
persons
personality
was
the
one
who
swallowed
you
and
did
the
bad
things
that
are
in
history
but
the
other
is
harmless...
Its
different.
Echidna
stops
<@203488399061942272>
from
trying
to
deal
with
the
surprised
information.
She
shook
her
head
and
corrected
<@203488399061942272>s
argument
Drinking
half
of
the
world
and
drinking
the
six
deadly
sin
witches
of
us
are
all
acts
of
Satella
not
jealous
witches.
Well!?
No
I
dont
think
its
a
bad
idea!
Satera
was
the
one
who
swallowed
you
and
if
its
Satera
whos
over
there...
Because
they
mesh
with
each
other
uh.
We
dont
forgive
the
jealous
witch
hu
but
if
Satella
doesnt
hold
grudges
uh.
Wow
I
am...
Satella-chan
but...
I
dont
like
it
but...
Im
just
better
than
a
witch...
Sekumeto
and
Carmira
agree
to
further
subarus
questions.
It
seems
to
be
the
unified
view
of
the
witches
but
that
is
something
that
<@203488399061942272>
cannot
understand.
The
one
who
destroyed
us
has
a
dual
personality
and
the
personality
that
destroyed
us
is
forgiven
but
not
the
one
who
isnt-what
does
that
mean?
I
always
argue
that
there
is
no
meaning
to
that
distinction...
Its
a
parallel
line
so
I
cant
ignore
that
intention
and
eliminate
it.
Or
in
my
weak
mental
body
After
they
have
been
eliminated
they
will
not
be
able
to
compete
if
they
are
revolted.
No
matter
how
I
am
if
the
state
of
my
soul
is
blown
away
I
cannot
return.
But...Isnt
that
a
risky
story
for
the
other
five?
Youre
in
charge
of
the
other
fives
souls.
If
you
disappear
youre
another
witch...
They
are
convinced
of
their
death
so
there
is
no
need
to
prolong
themselves
as
beings
of
only
a
soul.-If
you
bend
and
remain
yourself
you
should
marry
your
beliefs
and
destroy
them.
Much
better.
Im
a
witch
because
I
think
like
that.
Neither
Sekumet
nor
Carmilla
throws
a
negative
word
to
Echidnas
words.
<@203488399061942272>
has
no
words
because
the
witches
lives
are
too
fierce
because
she
is
too
close
to
say
that
she
is
pure.
If
so
everyone
would
longing
for
it.
However
even
after
dying
no
one
can
affirm
that
he
will
penetrate
it
even
after
his
death.
Minerva
too...
Probably
the
same.
Or
she
who
may
have
been
destroyed
before
anyone
else
by
the
hand
of
Jealous
witch.
Still
Minerva
believed
in
a
witch
who
had
done
nothing
within
his
reach
and
proved
it
as
a
result.
<@203488399061942272>
does
not
understand
their
relationship.
If
there
is
a
bond
that
believes
in
each
other
why
did
Jealous
Witch
destroy
the
other
six
witches?
And
why
do
the
witches
allow
it?
The
idea
of
u200bu200bEchidna
is
still
understandable
to
<@203488399061942272>.
But
still-
I
see
you
said
that.
Its
convincing...
Its
difficult
but
I
understand
but
I
havent
heard
what
it
was
here
for.
「――――」
I
didnt
ask
any
questions
I
knew
it
wouldnt
attack
me.
Ill
understand
that.
But
that
doesnt
mean
its
safe.
What
Ive
seen
so
far
is
the
Jealousy
Witch.
Then
what
would
Satella
want
me
to
do?
The
Jealous
Witch
is
just
a
damn
thing
to
me.
I
cant
understand
if
its
suddenly
said
to
be
different.
To
put
it
all
together
the
witches
must
have
swallowed
up
Satella
in
front
of
her.
Then
even
if
it
was
the
witch
of
jealousy
who
swallowed
the
sanctuary
it
would
be
possible
for
Satella
to
be
as
good
as
that.
Who
is
blamed
for
feeling
a
sense
of
danger
being
vigilant
and
moving
away.
What
did
you
want
to
do
and
why
you
came
here.
Unless
you
know...!
If
you
want
to
know
that
just
come
here.
Minerva
interrupted
<@203488399061942272>s
voice.
With
his
hands
on
his
hips
Minerva
gazes
at
<@203488399061942272>
with
his
irritated
face
resting
on
his
back
without
annoyance.
Its
enough
to
line
up
excuses
and
precautionary
lines
as
crap.
Nothing
happened
when
I
was
next
to
this
child
and
he
came
here
to
see
you.
Thats
it.
If
you
say
that
its
a
bad
thing
that
you
cant
even
come
close
to
you
cant
help
but
just
assume
that
it
was
just
another
of
us.
Is
there
any
misconception
or
shit?
Dont
guess
me
on
your
own!
Dont
force
yourself
on
me!
You
know
what
I
am!
It
is
impermissible
that
you
are
impressed
with
your
own
image
and
move
according
to
it.
There
was
once
a
voice
that
responded
to
<@203488399061942272>
when
he
shouted
for
the
same
thing.
I
remember
those
words.
At
that
time
Im
backed
by
the
words.
-If
you
can
not
betray
yourself
saved
by
those
words
at
that
time
Ah
shit...
youre
thinking
stupid
me...
Its
an
unreasonable
emotional
judgment
that
is
swept
away.
Until
now
I
have
no
remorse
for
how
much
pain
I
have
seen
because
of
doing
that.
Pay
more
attention
to
the
trivial
parts
of
things
kill
emotions
and
move
relentlessly
according
to
solid
facts
not
heart
movements-keeping
a
steel
heart
that
never
rocks.
Thats
right
Im
supposed
to
continue
to
make
wishes.
The
decision
is
slow.
Im
afraid
to
get
closer
to
the
other
person
who
was
on
the
verge
of
death...
shit
you
guys
understand.
I
cant
do
it.
Even
though
we
dont
have
anything
to
think
about.
Unlike
me
Sekumeto
and
Carmilla
are
just
adults.
I
have
a
reason
to
shoulder
myself.
Minerva
shrugged
saying
to
<@203488399061942272>
as
he
walked
up
and
tongue.
Minerva
yields
to
<@203488399061942272>
without
giving
him
time
to
find
out
why.
When
The
Witch
of
Fury
lays
sideways
<@203488399061942272>
will
naturally
face
the
witch-Satella
at
close
range.
「――――」
Suddenly
she
swallows
and
loses
her
words
due
to
the
strangeness
of
the
existence
in
front
of
her.
It
should
have
been
understood
by
looking
at
it
from
a
distance
and
walking
closer
to
it
but
it
was
still
possible
to
wipe
away
the
pressure
and
visual
sense
of
discomfort.
The
shadow
dress
that
sticks
to
the
body
is
sensationally
drawn
with
its
limbs
and
curves
and
even
the
fact
that
the
top
cannot
be
seen
from
the
neck
creates
even
a
perverted
luster.
All
those
impressions
are
wiped
out
by
unrecognizable
head
discomfort.
「――――」
In
close
proximity
<@203488399061942272>
notices
that
the
cognitive
deficit
is
not
physical.
The
fact
that
darkness
appears
to
cover
the
face
does
not
actually
obscure
it
so
that
the
shadow
does
not
cover
it.
I
cant
see
the
witchs
face
because
its
more
rooted
in
the
spirit.
The
face
is
not
invisible
because
of
physical
obstruction.
Its
instinctual
and
I
try
not
to
see
it.
Everyone
wants
to
turn
away
from
their
most
ugly
delusions.
.........
If
you
cant
see
it
its
a
matter
of
what
your
heart
is.
From
behind
grateful
advice
comes
in
to
support
<@203488399061942272>s
current
reasoning.
While
somehow
enduring
his
inner
feelings
<@203488399061942272>
ignores
Echidna--or
rather
continues
to
face
Satella
without
being
able
to
give
her
consciousness.
Still
there
is
no
active
action
from
Satella.
The
only
thing
Satella
has
done
is
that
she
is
only
here.
It
was
just
that
the
surrounding
people
made
a
fuss
about
themselves
and
were
eager
to
prevent
the
damage
from
spreading
to
her
actions.
Its
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
fact
that
shes
only
alive
and
already
presents
a
real
danger
of
her
existence.
At
that
moment
<@203488399061942272>
was
impatient
in
a
situation
of
no
movement.
--
「――――」
Suddenly
<@203488399061942272>s
throat
froze
when
I
saw
his
hands
extended
in
front
of
me.
<@203488399061942272>
was
concentrating
on
Satellas
behavior
even
at
one
moment
even
in
the
blink
of
an
eye.
After
the
moment
I
dont
know
what
will
happen-the
tense
feeling
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
movements
of
my
hands
that
seemed
to
appear
from
the
outside
of
my
consciousness.
I
wasnt
surprised
that
I
couldnt
see
the
movement.
<@203488399061942272>
clearly
saw
Satellas
arms
moving.
Despite
that
I
was
surprised
at
my
consciousness
that
the
arm
was
held
out
and
quietly
watched
the
situation
until
the
end
of
the
behavior.
You
really...what?
What
do
you
want
me
to
do?
The
fact
that
he
could
not
take
effective
action
against
his
extended
hand.
And
<@203488399061942272>
who
was
semi-unconsciously
understanding
what
it
meant
quickly
made
words.
Squeeze
out
so
that
you
dont
accept
the
fact
you
dont
face
each
other.
If
you
give
me
the
power
to
start
over...
why
is
that...
I
dont
understand
Satellas
intentions.
And
while
facing
Satella
standing
at
a
distance
where
she
could
touch
each
other
she
consciously
shouted
over
and
over
again
that
she
was
dangerous
but
she
couldnt
understand
her
body
without
listening.
――What
is
the
meaning
of
the
reaction
of
the
body
that
unconsciously
tries
to
relieve
in
front
of
her?
---U
--Ah?
<@203488399061942272>
who
is
unwilling
to
accept
his
own
body
is
delayed
in
responding
to
the
sound
of
hitting
the
eardrum.
This
in
turn
was
undoubtedly
the
right
reaction
to
events
that
came
from
outside
the
intention.
Breathing
<@203488399061942272>
waits
for
the
following
words.
In
the
front
Satella
slowly
took
a
long
time
to
say
to
<@203488399061942272>
waiting
for
her
words
again
with
a
still
invisible
expression
facing
<@203488399061942272>.

What
should
I
call
the
shock
that
penetrates
<@203488399061942272>s
whole
body
the
moment
I
hear
the
confession
of
love?
The
illusion
that
lightning
penetrated
from
the
top
of
the
head
to
the
toes
of
the
foot
hit
<@203488399061942272>.
The
sensation
of
the
skins
greasyness
with
open
pores
throughout
the
body
and
the
sensation
of
boiling
blood
in
the
blood
vessels
throughout
the
body.
The
vermilion
dyes
the
high
heartbeat
from
the
neck
to
the
top
leaking
rough
exhalation
and
<@203488399061942272>
moves
back.
You
cannot
stand
in
this
place
as
it
is.
If
you
stand
here
your
breath
will
reach
you.
My
fingertips
reach
me.
If
you
dont
open
up
the
distance
while
your
reason
can
push
your
instinct
the
brakes
wont
work.
If
that
happens
finally
<@203488399061942272>
is
swept
away
by
love.
Stop……
I
love
you
please
stop……
I
love
you
only
you
forever
Im
telling
you
to
stop--!
Shaking
his
head
wiping
his
arms
<@203488399061942272>
distracts
from
the
entwined
hot
gaze.
Still
Satellas
expression
in
front
is
not
visible
to
<@203488399061942272>.
Therefore
it
is
not
possible
for
<@203488399061942272>
to
know
what
kind
of
heat
her
gaze
is
for
gazing
at
<@203488399061942272>.
Although
it
should
have
been
<@203488399061942272>s
hot
heartbeat
did
not
seem
to
stop
all
at
once.
By
subduing
them
consciously
screaming
and
throwing
a
vomiting
refusal
<@203488399061942272>
kept
his
heart.
Literally
I
am
confident
that
unless
I
keep
trying
to
stay
conscious
the
root
of
my
existence
will
be
distorted.
It
was
a
horrifying
imagination
too.
Satella
faces
each
other
with
all
his
refusal
and
acting
as
if
he
hates
so
much
and
<@203488399061942272>
struggling
to
find
out
the
fact.
I
cant
understand
the
invisible
expression
the
expression
wrapped
in
the
dark
veil.
I
dont
know
but
<@203488399061942272>
finds
out
that
Satella
may
have
been
hurt
by
<@203488399061942272>s
words
and
acted
blindly.
Somewhere
in
my
heart
I
want
to
gently
rub
my
hair
put
a
word
of
comfort
on
my
painful
profile
and
whisper
to
love
and
make
me
smile.
Despite
this
denial
the
heart
continued
to
call
Satella
Love
You.
Oh...what
are
you
doing!
What
did
you
put
into
my
body!?
Like
the
seed
of
Return
to
Death
what
are
you
doing
with
my
heart?
<@203488399061942272>
hits
Satella
with
her
distrust
of
her
heart
which
does
not
follow
her
will.
My
heart
that
came
here
and
suddenly
began
to
show
a
reaction
beyond
my
understanding.
If
a
witch
with
supernatural
powers
is
interfering
with
her
strong
emotions
that
is
too
horrifying.
Distorting
a
persons
mind
at
will-that
is
the
worst
thing
a
person
can
do.
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>s
first
glory
in
the
world
was
his
love
for
Emilia.
For
<@203488399061942272>
who
could
not
rely
on
groping
the
gratitude
to
Emilia
who
reached
out
in
the
first
place
and
the
memory
that
even
the
worn
heart
was
saved
saved
her
presence
without
fading.
Keeps
on
making.
Incorporated
into
the
loop
of
days
that
continue
from
Death
and
overcome
various
difficulties
while
struggling
with
the
lone
army
the
number
of
important
things
to
protect
and
important
things
are
increasing
and
words
in
exchange
with
them
and
them
By
substituting
the
bonds
and
feelings
<@203488399061942272>
has
increased
what
he
holds.
Now
its
no
lie
to
say
that
the
only
driving
force
is
Emilia.
But
still
for
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>
the
first
light
was
Emilia.
Satella
asks
<@203488399061942272>
to
do
the
same
love
that
she
holds
for
Emilia.
Despite
the
words
exchanged
the
warmth
of
touching
each
other
the
time
spent
together
and
the
bonds
that
have
accumulated
even
though
there
is
nothing
between
each
other
they
are
trying
to
rob
only
love.
What
is
this
without
saying
horrible?
You
guys
Echidna...youre
messing
around!
Here.........I
dont
think
its
just
people
who
dont
understand!
<@203488399061942272>
screams
with
a
faceless
witch
standing
in
the
front
and
a
white-haired
witch
standing
behind
her.
Both
Satella
who
demands
love
without
content
and
Echidna
who
tries
to
entangle
others
with
curiosity
that
cannot
be
empathized
by
ordinary
people
are
both
monsters
beyond
<@203488399061942272>s
understanding.
Its
surprising
to
be
accompanied
by
it.
Even
if
I
treat
it
as
a
witch
its
a
vulgar
existence
less
than
a
witch
from
my
perspective.
Its
safe
to
say
that
I
cant
understand.
Im
sick.
Im
pretending
to
be
so
kind
of
you
Ill
never
forget
your
bad
luck....I
dont
have
any
sense
of
being
here.
Take
me
outside.
Im
already
with
you
I
dont
want
to
be
in
agreement!
Cursing
Echidnas
words
while
holding
his
head
<@203488399061942272>
begs
for
liberation
from
the
dream
castle.
I
dont
want
to
wait
another
second
before
Satella
and
Echidna.
<@203488399061942272>
has
a
myriad
of
things
to
do
and
not
when
it
comes
to
adding
content
here.
I
am
not
smart
and
versatile
but
I
have
a
limit
to
what
I
can
handle.
Why
are
problems
being
added
one
after
another
when
obstacles
that
exceed
the
allowable
limit
are
already
blocked?
I
cant
borrow
your
help.
Ill
handle
all
the
outside
problems
myself.
Thats
fine!
I
should
do
it
from
the
beginning...
And
then
again
Im
going
to
die
again
and
again
making
people
cry
and
making
excuses
I
had
no
choice
but
to
collect
information.
Minerva
with
his
arms
crossed
snorts
when
<@203488399061942272>
puts
his
words
for
farewell.
When
<@203488399061942272>
gazed
only
at
his
line
of
sight
Minerva
turned
his
clear
face
What?
What
do
you
intend
to
say
back?
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
you.
Its
all
my
problem
to
hurt
suffer
hurt
and
wear
out
in
return
to
death.
Its
the
kind
of
thing
you
tell
me.
Hey!
Im
prepared
to
be
painful
painful
and
painful.
Its
okay
for
the
person
who
says
it.
Its
okay
to
vomit
blood
and
tear
my
flesh
and
break
my
bones.
But
I
can
always
use
the
excuse
that
Im
in
charge
of
the
toughest
part.
What
did
you
say……!?
If
youre
more
visible
than
anyone
else
and
have
visible
flare
you
dont
have
to
say
anything
to
those
who
are
hurt
small
by
the
aftermath
of
your
actions
because
youre
the
hardest.
Because
you
hurt
the
most.
Because
you
are
the
most
painful...
Its
natural
to
contain
the
weak
sounds
around
you.
<@203488399061942272>
also
peels
off
its
fangs
in
Minerva
where
the
tone
gets
stronger
as
the
indignation
builds
up
in
his
mouth.
As
Subversive
said
<@203488399061942272>
cannot
help
refuting.
I!
I
want
to
say
that
Im
so
overwhelmed
by
tragedy
to
keep
everyones
words
in
the
air!
Is
my
my
blind
alley
doing
that?!
Aside
from
that
thats
not
the
case.
But
the
conclusion
is
that
you
should
hurt
yourself
better
than
anyone.
The
conclusion
is
cowardly.
I
dont
think
Echidnas
naiveness
and
I
cant
understand
how
Satellas
rotation
is...
but
I
am.
Your
way
of
distorting
is
a
lot
worse
than
a
witch.
「――――」
Of
all
from
the
point
of
view
of
my
way
of
life
that
heals
and
heals
everything
that
hurt
your
way
of
life
is
more
of
a
natural
enemy
than
a
polar
opposite.-This
child
is
not
so
rewarded.
With
a
small
fist
at
<@203488399061942272>
Minerva
screams.
Then
at
the
end
of
the
words
a
small
mutter
was
added
and
the
blue
eyes
turned
to
Satella
who
stood
beside
him.
Satella
who
has
been
standing
still
has
been
silent
since
<@203488399061942272>s
abusive
voice.
Neither
affirmation
nor
denial
expresses
intention
to
the
current
exchange.
I
found
Minerva
squinting
his
eyes
so
as
to
miss
him.
However
the
current
fluctuations
in
emotions
do
not
matter
to
<@203488399061942272>.
I
dont
feel
good...isnt
it
rewarding...
<@203488399061942272>s
shoulders
tremble
slightly
catching
Minervas
words.
The
quiver
eventually
grew
louder
and
<@203488399061942272>
was
laughing
when
he
looked
up.
It
was
so
stupid
that
I
couldnt
help
but
laugh.
What
the
hell
is
that?
Why
did
I
choose
this
way
of
doing
anything.
Why
did
I
get
your
distorted
way
of
thinking.
If
you
think
about
it
its
a
natural
consequence
of
what
I
have--its
true.
「――――」
You!
Me!
I
wonder
if
I
did
this!
<@203488399061942272>
rages
at
Satella
who
screams
and
tries
to
escape
her
responsibility
by
keeping
silence.
After
accepting
Return
to
Death
and
using
its
characteristics
to
overcome
obstacles
<@203488399061942272>
ran
through
to
this
point
while
struggling
with
various
hardships.
<@203488399061942272>
has
run
through
to
this
point
turning
the
desperation
of
death
that
he
has
enjoyed
many
times
into
the
force
of
stepping
into
each
soul.
--The
wounded
experience
of
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>
has
led
<@203488399061942272>
to
reach
that
idea.
Its
both
hurt
and
painful!
All
all
Im
alone!
Ill
be
long
enough!
Im
clenching
my
teeth
biting
all
my
anger
and
sorrow
Im
gonna
hurt
and
die.
Even
so
I
wont
let
anyone
in
my
despair
reach
my
fingertips!
Im
the
only
one
hurt
from
start
to
finish
thats
fine!
Whats
wrong!
By
repeating
return
to
death
we
can
find
the
best
way
by
trial
and
error.
Exactly
what
Echidna
said.
I
cant
take
Echidnas
invitation
to
try
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
by
taking
advantage
of
that
determination
but
I
just
have
to
keep
trying
the
same
thing
alone.
Unlike
Echidna
who
tries
to
make
an
extra
detour
<@203488399061942272>
who
devotes
himself
to
finding
the
best
way
should
have
far
fewer
retries
than
going
with
Echidna.
Of
course
I
could
imagine
that
it
would
be
a
tremendous
number
of
times.
But
its
still
worth
the
challenge.
If
there
is
a
future
where
no
one
will
be
hurt
beyond
the
stretched
hand
of
a
scratched
<@203488399061942272>.
I
didnt
understand
I
was
tired
of
telling
you.
Ah
it
was
bad
it
wasnt
a
lie
I
was
thankful
to
you.
I
forgot
it.
Forget
it
it
was
a
nice
thing
to
say
Im
sorry.
「――――」
“I
have
only
one
thing
to
thank
you.
Thank
you
for
letting
mereturn
to
death.
Im
grateful
for
that.
Without
this
I
wouldnt
protect
anything
important.
I
will
continue
to
rely
on
my
strength
so
Im
grateful
for
this
alone.
Im
already
prepared
to
try
and
error.
The
choice
to
escape
from
the
fate
of
standing
in
front
of
me
has
long
since
collapsed.
From
that
moment
when
he
rejected
<@203488399061942272>s
words
that
he
took
his
hand
and
asked
him
to
escape
together.
There
is
no
option
to
escape.
I
have
no
choice
but
to
continue
fighting.
I
swore
it.
She
also
expects
it
from
<@203488399061942272>.
I
believe.
That
<@203488399061942272>
will
not
escape
and
keep
fighting.
If
<@203488399061942272>
is
the
man
who
keeps
standing
up
then
<@203488399061942272>
cannot
continue
to
be
the
hero
of
Rem.
So
Im
just
grateful
for
this
power
that
you
gave
me.
Thanks
to
all
the
bad
guys
like
me
Im
stuck...
--No
The
situation...
<@203488399061942272>
suddenly
broke
the
silence
and
muttered
something
to
<@203488399061942272>
who
was
about
to
fold
up
the
heat
that
accumulated
in
her
chest.
Hearing
one
end
<@203488399061942272>s
words
slowed
down.
With
a
strong
face
<@203488399061942272>
again
asks
for
your
murmur.
What
did
you
say
now?
As
if
it
was
something
I
didnt
want
to
hear.
To
<@203488399061942272>s
breathtaking
Satella
after
a
brief
silence
said
again.
--Dont
cry.
Dont
hurt.
Dont
suffer.
Dont
make
a
sad
face.
Satella
whispered
to
<@203488399061942272>
as
if
to
appeal.
<@203488399061942272>s
heart
trembles
with
that
content.
It
was
anger
surprise
a
mix
of
all
mysterious
emotions.
Oh
you...
it...
The
emotional
vortex
is
so
big
that
I
dont
know
what
to
say.
With
a
throat
thirsty
<@203488399061942272>
opens
and
closes
staring
at
Satella.
Satella
continues
to
shake
the
turmoil
of
<@203488399061942272>.
So
love
me
Thats
it.....youre
doing
that
twisting
my
feelings
and
ultimately
letting
you
love
yourself.
That
kind
of
words...
--Wrong
Satella
who
shakes
her
head
blocks
the
trembling
words
of
<@203488399061942272>.
I
still
cant
see
the
expression.
However
<@203488399061942272>s
expression
on
the
side
of
the
book
of
darkness
satera
felt
with
her
skin
how
she
was
looking
at
her.
--Satella
she
is
now
<@203488399061942272>.
-Love
yourself
more
Im
sure
he
stares
at
me
with
a
compassionate
face.
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
It
took
me
a
long
time
to
swallow
the
meaning
of
the
word
that
was
conveyed
and
to
penetrate
into
the
brain.
Immediately
after
they
permeated
the
brain
it
was
an
intangible
trembling
wave
of
emotion
that
dominated
<@203488399061942272>s
heart.
What
are
you
talking
about?
...Dont
hurt.
Value
yourself
more
I
suppose
you
gave
me
the
return
to
death
power.
I
think
this
power
you
gave
me
gave
me
a
way
to
move
forward.
I
love
you.
So
love
you
too
and
protect
me.
If
Im
so
cute
and
rob
me
of
this
way!
What
can
I
say!
Screaming
<@203488399061942272>
puts
his
hand
on
his
chest
and
rejects
Satella
who
whispers
endless
love.
You
also
know!
I
have
no
power!
I
have
no
wisdom
or
skill
no
special
power!
Nothing
I
have
is
return
to
death
you
gave
me.
Then
I
can
only
pay
for
my
life!
Dont
be
sad
Ive
already
factored
in
pain
and
death.
Im
fine
and
thats
fine!
If
Im
the
only
one
in
pain
thats
fine!
Dont
suffer
“If
I
hurt
more
than
anyone
I
experience
more
than
anyone
I
stand
around
so
I
can
protect
everyone
no
one
but
me
has
to
worry!
I
dont
want
it!
do
not
Cry
I
dont
care
what
happened
to
me!?
Nobody
cares
about
what
happens
to
someone
like
me!
How
much
tattered
I
am
if
everyone
can
safely
reach
the
future
And
then...
Because
if
<@203488399061942272>
doesnt
continue
to
get
hurt
on
the
front
line
like
that
If
the
future
can
be
welcomed
without
anyone
missing
then...
--Also
you
might
lose
someone
in
an
irreversible
place.
...I
dont
have
REM
「――――」
If
I
was
smarter
I
was
more
powerful
I
spared
myself
more
and
I
was
at
the
top
of
the
body...
it
would
have
been
avoided.
The
feeling
of
loss
at
that
time
the
feeling
of
despair
has
tied
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>
all
the
time.
Thats
why
<@203488399061942272>
now
chose
not
to
rely
on
anyone
but
alone
to
continue
to
fight
hurt.
I
believed
that
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do.
Thats
why
I
have
to
believe...
theres
a
way
I
can
do
it
I
have
to
believe...
Return
to
death
is
the
solution
to
everything.
If
he
could
use
it
well
<@203488399061942272>
wouldnt
lose
anything.
If
you
dont
convince
yourself
that
believing
saying
and
being
hurt
is
necessary
how
can
you
challenge
that
sense
of
despair
again?
“I
don’t
want
to
lose
anyone
like
REM
anymore!”
Holding
his
head
<@203488399061942272>
screams
rejecting
all
the
sounds
he
can
hear.
Before
I
knew
it
I
was
sunk
into
the
ground
before
I
knew
it.
Forgetting
even
away
from
Satella
she
escapes
into
her
shell
and
as
she
gets
smaller
<@203488399061942272>
denies
the
sweet
whisper.
Its
poison.
Its
deadly
poison.
For
<@203488399061942272>
Satellas
existence
is
all
a
poison
that
seeks
to
melt
its
will.
If
I
dont
get
crushed
the
heart
of
<@203488399061942272>
who
should
have
sworn
so
will
crack.
The
cold
despair
inserted
through
the
cracks
revives
the
feeling
of
loss
on
that
day
and
makes
<@203488399061942272>s
heart
struck.
Im
not
a
child.
There
was
a
whispering
noise.
Crying
stubbornly
obsessed
with
the
conclusions
made
by
himself
seeing
<@203488399061942272>
shook
his
head
unwillingly
the
witch
who
had
been
silent
until
then
whispered
murmuring.
Cry
shout
hate
me
and
hold
it
all
by
myself.
「――――」
--Im
not
a
lonely
child.
With
a
pitiful
voice
Sekmet
described
the
current
<@203488399061942272>
as
such.
The
witches
who
are
silent
in
Sectumes
murmuring
will
not
deny
it.
As
for
his
appearance
the
words
of
the
current
lazy
witch
were
too
accurate.
Thats
what
<@203488399061942272>
looks
like
nowadays
like
a
weak
small
child
to
the
point
of
pity.

Immediately
after
realizing
that
oxygen
has
passed
through
his
throat
<@203488399061942272>
coughs
like
a
vomiting
blood
clot
remaining
in
his
trachea.
With
the
person
lying
on
his
back
lying
on
the
ground
he
sought
for
oxygen
and
food
by
repeatedly
breathing
and
breathing.
I
cant
afford
to
think
of
myself
as
being
too
shallow.
However
I
felt
terribly
miserable
when
I
bite
my
tongue
out
in
hopes
of
death
and
cling
to
the
salvage
way
that
flickered
before
my
eyes
without
hesitation.
But
To
me...
--Yup?
Is
it
worth
living...?
Not
dying...
Is
it
worth
other
than
dying
and
repeating...is
it...?
Do
return
to
death
and
rescue
everyone
from
the
edge
of
despair.
I
believed
that
the
only
result
of
paying
my
life
was
the
value
of
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>.
But
is
it
okay
to
think
thats
not
the
case?
I
think
human
beings
have
a
value
other
than
return
to
death...I
think
people
who
I
like...
think
that
I
like
them
and
I
think
so
…Okay?”
...I
dont
know
that.
Minerva
turns
facelessly
and
subtly
answers
<@203488399061942272>s
weak
questions.
Losing
her
right
arm
and
both
legs
she
dexterously
moves
away
from
<@203488399061942272>
with
her
left
hand
and
first
turns
her
face
to
her
right
shoulder-biting.
Shortly
thereafter
a
drop
of
light
regenerated
Minervas
missing
right
arm.
Open
and
close
the
fist
on
the
right
arm
with
the
sleeves
removed
and
then
Minerva
strikes
both
feet
with
both
hands-the
root
of
the
foot
with
the
thighs
underneath
regenerating
both
feet
in
the
same
way
as
the
arms.
The
skirt
which
was
originally
short
has
become
even
more
conspicuous
and
the
right
arm
is
exposed
to
the
shoulders
which
is
extremely
dangerous
but
Minerva
the
witches
of
fury
is
back
in
perfect
condition.
She
stood
firm
with
her
legs
back
and
looked
down
at
<@203488399061942272>
with
her
arms
crossed
and
a
pose
that
emphasized
the
rich
chest.
And
I
dont
know
your
value
but
he
wants
you
to
live...
youve
seen
two
trials?
“But
the
second
“trial”
is
my
sin
the
guilty
of
doing…”
Isnt
that
stupid?
It
wasnt
trying
to
get
you
to
take
responsibility
for
the
wrong
world.
It
showed
you
who
was
sad
and
how
sad
you
were
as
a
result.
-Youre
not
the
answer
you
wanted.
---Hi
remember.
Cry
A
voice
that
bites
and
repents.
A
powerful
voice
to
send
out.
The
usual
gentle
send-off.
A
whisper
of
love
that
you
believe
in.
The
beginning
words
that
became
the
driving
force
of
<@203488399061942272>s
fight.
It
was
a
life
I
shouldnt
have
had.
I
thought
<@203488399061942272>
had
been
invited
to
this
world
with
nothing
and
without
what
I
had.
To
prove
my
worth
I
have
to
keep
fighting.
In
order
to
protect
the
important
things
that
I
gained
while
continuing
to
resist
I
have
to
keep
walking
even
more
lonely.
I
was
convinced
that
it
was
just
given
but
I
wonder
if
it
wasnt.
Will
you
cry
for
me?
Will
you
mourn
for
my
lack
of
strength?
Do
you
want
to
see
the
future
with
me?
Can
you
give
me
the
qualification
to
laugh
and
stand
next
to
my
loved
ones?
Qualifications
that
do
not
know
whether
it
is
there
or
not.
But
Im
sure
its
something
that
<@203488399061942272>
wouldnt
be
allowed
to
carry
after
he
had
walked
the
path
he
had
stubbornly
decided
to
walk
alone.
After
making
your
heart
steel
and
fighting
with
unwavering
spiritual
power
nothing
will
leave
even
the
softness
that
makes
you
smile.
If
so
can
I
believe
it?
Even
if
you
choose
to
lose
your
heart
instead
of
getting
the
future
of
your
loved
ones.
Even
with
the
choice
that
you
cant
keep
your
way
because
you
are
desperate
to
protect
your
heart.
Its
okay
if
you
have
a
greedy
option
that
is
neither.
Is
it
okay
to
believe
that
there
is
a
choice
that
allows
us
to
see
the
future
with
our
loved
ones
as
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>?
-I
forgive
you
「――――」
The
feelings
of
<@203488399061942272>
who
just
spilled
tears
did
not
speak
out.
The
timing
was
meshed
as
if
it
had
been
transmitted
as
a
sound.
With
his
body
lying
on
the
ground
and
his
face
moving
beyond
Minerva-with
his
knees
in
the
grassland
without
even
wiping
his
teary
face
I
saw
a
smiling
face.
The
face
is
still
invisible
to
<@203488399061942272>.
Even
now
I
cant
understand
the
expression
faced
by
<@203488399061942272>
which
was
blocked
by
the
book
of
darkness.
But
I
can
tell
you
that
Im
smiling.
Echidna
was
saying.
<@203488399061942272>
cant
see
her
because
its
not
accepting
her.
When
I
smile
thats
the
only
reason
why
Im
seeing
what
I
really
see
as
<@203488399061942272>s
unconsciousness.
I
have
been
saved
by
you.
So
I
allow
you
to
be
saved.
I
hope
you
will
be
saved.
<@203488399061942272>
covers
her
face
with
her
arms
when
Satellas
words
are
heard
as
her
voice
rushes
into
her
cracked
heart.
I
couldnt
help
showing
this
face
to
anyone
even
though
Im
sure
its
a
mess
with
tears
and
its
a
face
that
will
never
disappear.
How
can
we
still
get
the
relief
of
Satellas
words
after
such
a
big
curse?
Whats
more
the
expression
that
softens
it
is
shown.
However
it
is
also
true
that
the
strange
words
of
Satellas
love
made
<@203488399061942272>
understand
the
true
meaning
of
trials.
...Im
surprised
that
Minerva
broke
through
the
obstacles
of
Tufon
and
Sekmet
but
I
personally
find
it
surprising
that
you
two
are
doing
it.
It
is
Echidna
who
murmured
so
small
with
<@203488399061942272>
covering
his
sight.
Looking
at
Minerva
who
has
revived
both
hands
and
feet
Echidna
then
moves
his
gaze
in
another
direction--there
is
Tuffon
which
is
held
in
a
claw-like
limb
extending
from
a
black-painted
casket
and
the
chief
of
the
casket.
There
is
a
scene
where
Daphne
and
Sekmet
face
each
other.
It
was
Daphne
who
laughed
laughing
low
in
Echidnas
words.
She
broke
the
lower
part
of
the
restraint
garment
and
barely
stepped
on
the
grass
sticking
her
tongue
Its
definitely
Daphne
that
has
the
best
compatibility
with
Tutyu.
I
dont
think
that
a
100-foot
casket
is
Daphnes
limbs
which
has
no
thought
so
its
the
worst
compatibility
with
Tutyus
authority.
Uh
its
Hune!
Hmm!
Hmm!
Well
I
mean
youre
the
one
who
restrains
you
huh.
Its
not
Echidna
huh.
What
you
imitate
huh.
Unlike
Minerva
why
you
hold
your
shoulders.
I
dont
know.
Sekumeto
is
a
sharp
and
violently
scratching
too
much
hair.
She
seems
to
be
unable
to
make
a
roundabout
move
when
Tuffon
is
taken
hostage.
In
response
to
Sekumets
doubts
Daphne
shook
the
bunch
of
short
hair
and
laughed
No
<@203488399061942272>
I
hit
Daphne
with
a
big
shot.
I
killed
the
white
whale
so
it
looks
like
its
a
rabbit
next
time.
I
wonder
if
Id
like
to
have
a
challenge
at
least.
Its
an
interesting
opinion.
If
he
wants
it
it
will
certainly
be
fulfilled.
You
know
it
but...
do
you
want
to
destroy
the
hare?
Ah?
When
I
separated
it
from
Daphne
the
hunger
of
those
children
is
unrelated
to
Daphnes
hunger.
I
dont
know
where
it
perishes
but...
In
any
case
Daphnes
endless
hunger
itself.
The
rabbit
may
be
interested
in
how
it
ends.
Daphne
continued
he
said.
If
the
end
is
fulfilled
its
a
blessing
unknown
to
Daphne.
For
Daphne
who
is
constantly
frustrated
by
an
endless
hunger
fullness
is
a
dream
that
will
never
reach.
And
the
Rabbit
is
another
person
who
reflects
her
endless
feeling
of
hunger.
――Although
Daphne
himself
has
no
such
affinity.
If
the
rabbit
is
going
to
end
up
differently
than
it
used
to
be
is
it
filled
or
not?
She
laughs
whether
it
was
possible
that
she
might
be
satisfied
which
is
unusual
and
she
may
have
an
interest
other
than
appetite.
Echidna
nodded
to
Daphnes
answer
with
satisfaction
and
then
turned
his
head
again.
Its
not
<@203488399061942272>
Satella
or
Minerva
that
heads.
A
person
who
stands
in
a
position
isolated
from
the
group
like
Echidna
not
Daphne
Sekmet
and
Tufon
who
fought
fierce
fights.
Echidna
gently
stroked
her
gray
hair
when
she
saw
Carmila
the
Witch
of
Desire.
Carmir
how
are
you?
Is
there
a
reason
like
Daphne?
Hmm...
do
you
want
to
say
that?
Echidna-chan...?
Its
easy.--I
think
his
consciousness
at
the
edge
of
death
called
for
it
on
the
verge
of
disappearing.
If
you
the
authority
of
the
Muslimless
Goddess
did
it
the
result
would
have
been
known.
「――――」
Your
call
would
have
meant
all
to
him
and
you
would
have
understood
it.
So
I
would
ask.
You
wouldnt
have
liked
him.
Why?”
Carmilla
puts
her
hand
on
her
mouth
and
wanders
as
she
asks
Echidna.
Directed
to
Daphne
and
Minerva
it
is
a
movement
that
expects
follow-up
from
people
other
than
myself.
However
there
is
no
witch
seduced
by
Carmilla
who
is
loved
by
everyone.
Carmilla
bites
her
finger
like
no
help
moistens
her
eyes
and
looks
at
Echidna
Why?
No
reason
no?
Eki
Donna-chan
wasnt
invited
so
Im
satisfied
enough...
no
matter
what
everyone
was
upset
about
......Wow
dont
fly
to
me
or
if
you
dont...
then...
However?
Ah
Love
is
important...
isnt
it?
If
you
despise
it
its
no
good...
No
I
dont
want
to
see
that
girl...
is
there
so...
there
is
something...
denial
and
I
dont
want
to
let
it
go...
Only
in
the
last
part
Echidna
shrugs
for
Carmila
who
asserts
himself
clearly.
Then
the
greedy
witch
who
smiled
bitterly
looked
at
each
witchs
face
“Sekmet
and
Tuffon
tried
to
respect
his
will
Minerva
healed
his
life
healed
him.
Daphne
worked
to
prolong
his
life
to
see
his
willingness
to
fight
and
Carmilla
turned
his
eyes
away.
He
used
his
authority
to
teach
his
continued
affection.-Now
everyone
is
trying
to
help
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>
albeit
with
their
allegations.
When
Echidna
describes
the
witches
actions
as
such
the
witches
completely
change
their
expressions.
Arrogance
tilts
his
head
laziness
sighs
loosely
anger
snorts
and
crosses
his
arms
overeating
laughs
by
eating
one
leg
extending
from
the
coffin
and
lust
distorts
his
face
disgustingly.
And
the
greedy
who
saw
them
put
his
hand
on
his
chin
Its
still
interesting.-Do
you
think
so?
Echidna
loosens
her
mouth
and
smiles
happily.
The
point
of
her
words
was
directed
to
the
front—swayingly
to
<@203488399061942272>
who
shook
and
stood
up.
Even
now
<@203488399061942272>
manages
to
stand
on
two
legs
while
wiping
the
scars
of
tears
with
his
sleeves
and
he
does
not
answer
Echidnas
question.
However
he
looks
around
at
Echidna
and
the
faces
of
the
witches
with
his
unrelenting
eyes.
And
You
guys...
really
what?
「――――」
Curious.
Pity.
Pity.
Mission.
Expectation.
Aversion.
Isnt
it
just
that
your
energy
has
returned
to
the
point
of
cursing?
...I
dont
know.
As
Echidna
closes
her
eyes
<@203488399061942272>
put
her
hand
on
her
chest
and
murmured.
The
leaked
words
simply
expressed
all
the
feelings
of
<@203488399061942272>
today.
I
must
have
decided
what
I
had
to
do.
What
I
have
to
do
is
still
the
same
now.
Thats
true.
Its
true.
But
lets
continue
saying
so
that
<@203488399061942272>
does
not
tell
anyone
but
himself
I
had
decided
that
this
was
the
only
way
to
do
that.
I
was
determined
to
choose
it.
But
I
came
to
this
place
and
broke
it
into
trials.
The
second
trial
the
unprecedented
now-it
struck
the
result
of
<@203488399061942272>s
actions
against
<@203488399061942272>
and
broke
his
heart
in
a
very
real
situation
that
was
being
deceived
by
the
word
prepared.
Even
after
being
shown
it
<@203488399061942272>
sought
to
divide
himself
and
tried
to
stick
to
his
determination.
In
fact
it
was
supposed
to.
But
knowing
your
true
intention
that
you
could
get
a
hand
Satella
appeared
in
quick
succession
there...
My
head
is
messed
up.
Dont
put
your
own
things
together.
I
had
to
do
what
I
had
to
do
yet...
Nowadays
what
do
you
do
with
the
life
that
should
be
divisible
by
consumables
cling
to
it?
Now
lets
learn
to
spare
the
life
that
is
supposed
to
be
used
up
and
what
to
do.
What
should
I
do
now
that
I
am
aware
of
my
love
for
myself?
I
dont
know
what
to
do
now...
<@203488399061942272>s
reason
is
crying
that
he
cannot
protect
everyone
without
dying.
<@203488399061942272>s
memory
tells
us
that
there
are
people
who
are
sad
about
<@203488399061942272>
cutting
himself.
Someone
will
grieve
if
you
dont
die
but
someone
will
grieve
if
you
die.
-Ill
ask
you
again
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>
Echidna
dilutes
her
voice
as
<@203488399061942272>
shakes
her
head.
When
I
raised
my
face
Echidna
with
one
finger
up
was
in
front
of
<@203488399061942272>.
She
nodded
slowly
when
she
saw
<@203488399061942272>s
gaze
reflected
at
her.
If
I
work
with
you
you
will
surely
reach
a
future
that
saves
those
who
want
to
save.
You
wont
have
to
worry.
In
extreme
terms
I
will
solve
the
problems
you
face.
You
just
have
to
do
it
yourself
and
be
conscious
of
overcoming
the
barriers.
If
youre
having
trouble
keeping
up
its
an
option
to
leave
it
all
to
me.
Lets
welcome
so
I
will
ask
you
again.
「――――」
Can
you
pull
me
your
hand
I
dont
know
what
to
do?
I
promise
to
take
you
to
the
future.
So
kindly
Echidna
reaches
out
to
<@203488399061942272>.
<@203488399061942272>
held
her
breath
down
as
she
looked
down
at
her
white
fingertip
and
saw
Echidnas
face
waiting
for
an
answer.
Its
the
same
narrative
that
I
had
when
I
had
a
dialogue
on
refusal.
At
that
time
<@203488399061942272>
was
aware
of
Echidnas
true
nature
and
was
afraid
of
the
nerve
that
was
driven
only
by
his
intimidating
curiosity.
But
what
about
now?
What
if
you
take
a
moment
to
calmly
think
of
her?
Treating
life
as
a
consumable
item
performing
all
kinds
of
trial
and
error
and
forcibly
breaking
through
the
obstacles
that
will
be
blocked
by
a
technique
that
can
be
called
a
force
technique.
With
Echidnas
advice
<@203488399061942272>s
appearance
of
continuing
to
fight
while
eroding
his
mind-what
is
different
from
the
appearance
of
<@203488399061942272>
who
was
prepared
to
continue
fighting
alone
even
if
she
refused
her
cooperation.
<@203488399061942272>
rejected
Echidnas
disgust
for
her
attitude
as
she
refused.
However
if
I
was
prepared
to
sacrifice
myself
in
the
truest
sense
of
all
I
should
even
look
at
Echidnas
true
nature
and
use
her
as
she
said.
If
even
that
is
denied
by
my
own
habit
and
the
path
is
still
the
same-what
does
<@203488399061942272>s
reluctant
attitude
mean?
You
should
take
that
hand.
If
you
were
prepared
to
continue
fighting
without
fearing
being
hurt
swallowing
painful
and
painful
feelings.
I
should
have
taken
that
hand.
So
Echidna
「――――」
Im
afraid
of
getting
hurt.
「――――」
I
dont
want
it
to
be
painful
painful
or
sad.
I
dont
want
to
feel
pain
and
I
dont
want
to
see
someone
other
than
me
terrible.-I
dont
want
to
die.
「――――」
So
your
hand
on
the
premise
of
sacrifice--I
cant
take
it
anymore.
What
<@203488399061942272>
can
do
is
not
even
clear
to
<@203488399061942272>.
But
choosing
the
same
path
that
Echidna
presents
is
no
longer
possible.
I
realized
that
I
didnt
want
to
die.
I
knew
that
there
were
people
who
admitted
that
I
could
only
contribute
by
dying
even
if
I
didnt
die.
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>
was
not
a
man
whose
only
value
is
to
die.
The
people
who
spared
<@203488399061942272>s
death
did
not
spare
<@203488399061942272>
for
finding
the
value
of
<@203488399061942272>s
death.
Then
what
were
they
spared
for
<@203488399061942272>s
what?
I
still
dont
know
what
it
is.-But
Ill
try
to
find
it.
Once
I
know
it
I
feel
like
Im
rewarding
everyone
in
a
way
other
than
death.
...But
thats
the
thorny
road
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>.
The
road
that
cuts
itself
by
cutting
death
as
a
tool
that
cuts
through
the
road
and
shaving
itself
the
roughest
but
surely
the
shortest
way
to
reach
the
future.
What
you
offered
was
only
your
heart.
It
was
too
difficult
to
deny
it
and
get
both
your
heart
and
your
precious
human
future
and
above
all-
Echidna
cuts
her
words
and
holds
her
breath.
And
she
has
the
most
glamorous
smile
ever
--
Greedy
The
greedy
witch
who
affirms
her
desire
accepts
<@203488399061942272>s
decision
with
a
pleasant
expression.
After
all
<@203488399061942272>
cannot
understand
the
idea
of
u200bu200bthe
witch
who
rejected
the
proposal
and
still
laughs
happily.
However
Its
true
that
Ive
been
saved
to
you
many
times....
Even
if
youre
at
the
bottom
of
your
stomach
and
you
think
of
me
as
an
experimental
animal
or
something
thats
true.
It
was
true
that
he
was
able
to
survive
the
hardships
with
the
support
of
Echidna.
So
Im
really
grateful
that
I
had
the
time
to
give
me
some
grace
to
protect
my
heart.
-Silly
and
pathetic
Garfir
fears
the
outside
world.
……e?
What
the
child
saw
in
the
first
trial
is
to
keep
him
bound
all
the
time.
If
you
want
to
break
the
situation
on
your
own
youll
need
to
break
the
spell.
Echidna?
Its
ridiculous
if
the
other
witches
behaved
favorably
for
you
but
this
is
the
only
thing
I
wouldnt
offer.
In
you
Im
sorry
but
Echidna
was
the
only
bad
guy
to
the
end.
Im
still
a
girl
and
its
true
that
youre
also
friendly
to
me.
Echidna
slammed
<@203488399061942272>s
chest
lightly
with
his
hand.
Pushed
by
that
momentum
Echidna
turned
her
back
when
<@203488399061942272>
raised
her
face.
A
greedy
witch
that
shakes
her
white
hair
and
takes
her
away
from
<@203488399061942272>.
Other
witches
are
quietly
gazing
at
<@203488399061942272>.
...For
me
all
you
guys
cant
understand
「――――」
He
was
so
confused
that
he
could
be
crazy
and
I
was
still
angry
at
what
I
was
told.
Ive
always
been
wondering
if
Im
not
talking
over
my
head.
I
cant
like
them.
Its
the
real
intention.
Each
of
the
witches
has
an
unwavering
sense
of
value
which
is
arguably
incompatible
with
<@203488399061942272>--or
no
ordinary
person.
So
<@203488399061942272>
cant
understand
them
and
theyre
not
satisfied
with
their
actions.
But
as
much
as
I
thought
about
Echidna
its
different
from
not
understanding
and
thanking.
“Thank
you
for
letting
me
die.
Thank
you
for
not
letting
me
die.
Thank
you
for
letting
me
hear
your
important
voice.
—Thank
you.”
I
bow
down
to
each
of
the
witches
and
feel
awful
as
they
breathe.
Then
<@203488399061942272>
turns
around
and
begins
to
walk.
Beyond
that
is
Satella
a
girl
who
is
still
kneeling
in
the
grassland.
She
looked
up
at
<@203488399061942272>
approaching
her
and
held
her
breath
to
choke
her
throat.
<@203488399061942272>
loses
her
voice
in
the
frightened
appearance
and
the
appearance
of
the
little
girl.
Why
do
warm
things
fill
the
heart
with
people
who
feel
even
horrible?
What
is
the
feeling
you
keep
holding
for
someone
you
have
never
touched?
<@203488399061942272>
has
given
too
many
unanswered
questions
here.
Without
giving
any
answers
<@203488399061942272>
reaches
out
to
the
witch
who
sits
down
choosing
to
continue.
She
looked
confused
at
the
offered
hand.
I
dont
know
what
you
are...
I
wonder
why
you
say
I
like
you...
I
say...
I
dont
know
the
meaning
of
the
words
that
helped
you.
Ah……
But
its
true
that
youve
been
helped
by
the
return
to
death
that
you
gave
me.
Its
true
that
I
could
rely
on
it
and
manage
to
do
so
far.
「――――」
Is
return
to
death
one
of
the
options...?
「――――」
The
thing
that
you
cant
depend
on
is
that
you
love
yourself...
do
you
say
that?
「――――」
I
cant
say
its
easy.-But
Im
certain
that
you
gave
me
return
to
death
and
made
me
think
I
didnt
want
to
die.
So
As
you
say
just
a
little
more...
I
like
myself.
I
value
myself.
I
dont
know
what
happens
but
thats
fine.
……All
right?
Oh...
whats
that
compared
to
dying?
In
response
to
the
worried
Satellas
voice
<@203488399061942272>
smiled
weakly.
Looking
at
that
expression
Satella
took
<@203488399061942272>s
hand
so
that
she
could
feel
relieved.
Soon
after
the
cracking
sounds
of
the
world
caught
<@203488399061942272>s
eardrum.
The
blue
sky
and
the
green
meadow
fade
away
and
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>
is
released
by
the
dream
castle.
--Are
you
going
back?
What
I
was
doing
what
I
was
doing
and
how
I
got
here
are
dim.
What
should
I
do
when
I
go
outside?
The
problem
of
the
mind
makes
even
that
vague.
Dont
worry
alone.
With
people
who
care
about
you...
「――――」
Resistance
together
with
those
who
dont
want
you
to
die
and
those
who
dont
want
you
to
die..
If
you
still
cant
reach
dont
forget
to
fear
death
and
die.
「――――」
Dont
forget
that
you
will
die
and
that
some
people
are
sad--
The
world
makes
noise
and
shatters.
Satellas
voice
is
getting
farther.
It
terribly
scratches
the
heart
of
<@203488399061942272>.
The
connected
palms
are
burning
hot.
I
feel
like
I
shouldnt
let
go
of
this
hand.
--I
am
I
cant
say
what
to
call.
I
cant
hear
her
calling
Satella.
If
you
dont
speak
the
name
youre
in
a
hurry
to
reject
her
and
accept
her.
The
sky
is
falling.
The
ground
breaks.
The
light
is
overflowing
and
the
surrounding
area
no
longer
forms
a
dream
castle.
The
witches
have
disappeared
and
there
are
only
two
people
in
the
world
<@203488399061942272>
and
Satella.
Disappear.
And
it
begins.
--<@203488399061942272>
stared
at
Satella
in
front
of
him
without
being
able
to
say
anything.
「――――」
Suddenly
the
book
of
darkness
fell.
If
you
dont
want
to
see
it
the
jet
black
that
should
have
been
denied
by
<@203488399061942272>s
unconsciousness
is
thrown
away.
Then
<@203488399061942272>
took
a
breath
as
he
looked
at
the
face
from
below.
In
a
breathtaking
<@203488399061942272>
Satella
sways
her
silver
hair
narrows
her
purple-navy
eyes
and
spills
tears
from
the
edges
of
her
eyes.
And
someday-be
sure
to
kill
me
Disappear.
Lost.
The
world
disappears
and
you
cant
even
see
the
girl
in
front
of
you.
I
must
be--
However
holding
firmly
so
as
to
check
only
the
warmth
of
the
palm
<@203488399061942272>
--I
will
save
you
All
that
was
said
to
the
dear
little
girl
who
disappeared.
Well
lets
go
like
that.
Isnt
it
good
hoo?
His
decision
was
my
choice.
I
want
to
respect
it...
I
cant
help
but
think
of
it.
Echidna
shrugs
on
the
spot
in
response
to
the
lax
voice
of
Sekmet.
They
are
still
in
the
castle
of
dreams
nothing
has
changed
in
the
grasslands
and
the
blue
sky.
The
cool
breeze
blows
through
gently
stroking
the
witches
hair.
――As
soon
as
the
cracked
world
swallowed
<@203488399061942272>
and
Satella
and
released
them
from
their
dreams
the
world
was
repaired
again.
Of
course.
The
space
connected
to
Echidnas
soul
which
cannot
be
destroyed
will
remain
in
this
state
as
long
as
Echidna
exists.
It
was
just
an
overdraft
that
drove
away
the
quitters.
But
when
youre
provoked
by
you
too
I
cant
help
feeling
tired.
Id
be
happy
if
I
took
a
little
more
care
to
treat
me.
I
will
heal
my
wounds
that
I
can
see
according
to
my
style.
Humans
witches
animals
birds
fish
insects
monsters
and
beasts
alike
the
wounds
of
life
are
my
enemies!
But
unlike
when
I
was
alive
the
burden
of
doing
your
work
here
comes
to
me.
Because
I
used
to
take
over
the
world
when
I
was
alive
its
also
my
imagination
that
it
costs
me
all
alone.
Dont
you
know
how
tough
it
is?
I
dont
care
about
feeling
tired
or
invisible.
I
heal
my
wounds.
I
suppose
the
worlds
life
may
be
shortened
but
I
dont
know.
The
witches
grin
at
Minervas
affirmation
which
folds
his
arms
and
emphasizes
his
rich
chest.
Minerva
the
witches
of
fury
is
the
most
familiar
of
the
witches
who
bear
the
name
of
the
deadly
sin
at
first
glance-though
it
tends
to
seem
like
a
harmless
witch.
In
fact
all
her
actions
are
curative
actions
and
the
number
of
lives
saved
by
her
hands
in
the
world
at
that
time
may
not
be
more
than
five
digits.
-However
it
was
Minerva
that
caused
the
damage
indirectly.
All
of
the
destructive
energies
such
as
hitting
kicking
and
biting
are
converted
into
healing
energy
when
emitted
from
her
hands.
Because
the
technique
is
the
power
of
wrath
it
cannot
be
imitated
by
anyone
but
her.
Even
Echidna
can
understand
the
structure
but
cannot
reproduce
it.
Minervas
healing
blows
away
from
the
life-threatening
threats
of
every
creature.
-It
seems
to
be
an
all-purpose
authority
but
it
is
a
mistake.
The
healing
power
of
her
fist
is
the
result
of
a
powerful
technique
that
twists
and
bends
the
cause
and
effect
consuming
enormous
mana
each
time
it
is
activated.
It
is
not
the
amount
that
one
human
being
can
cover
but
the
amount
that
is
impossible
even
with
the
magical
knowledge
of
the
witch
Minerva.
So
where
does
her
blow
come
from
mana-the
answer
is
simply
decapitating
from
the
core
of
the
world.
Normally
when
humans
use
magic
it
means
that
mana
in
the
atmosphere
is
absorbed
from
the
gate
converted
into
magic
energy
and
emitted
from
the
gate
again
to
exercise
magic.
In
the
case
of
Minerva
this
gate
is
directly
connected
to
the
center
of
the
world
not
the
atmosphere.
The
expression
of
the
center
of
the
world
is
difficult
and
it
is
connected
to
the
supernatural
collection
of
mana-a
place
where
mana
is
born.
Minervas
blow
extracts
mana
from
it
and
transforms
it
into
a
healing
blow.
When
this
is
repeated
the
phenomenon
that
mana
does
not
spread
to
the
place
where
it
should
be
supplied
originally
occurs
and
the
depletion
of
mana
which
is
an
important
element
that
constitutes
the
world
is
extremely
dangerous
which
causes
natural
disasters
and
natural
disasters
in
areas
that
did
not
reach
It
creates
new
possibilities.
The
number
of
people
that
she
directly
hit
and
healed
exceeds
five
digits.
――But
the
number
of
people
who
died
due
to
the
catastrophe
that
she
indirectly
caused
is
comparable
to
that.
Minerva
the
witches
of
fury
was
therefore
considered
the
most
dangerous
of
all
the
witches
who
bear
the
name
of
the
deadly
sin
and
was
viewed
as
hostile
by
all
nations.
At
this
point
the
only
mana
I
pull
out
is
what
Echidna
has.
Im
dissatisfied
because
you
can
only
heal
and
heal
until
its
about
to
be
sun-dried.
In
the
first
place
there
should
be
no
reason
for
an
injury
to
occur.
Its
a
bit
too
noisy
for
a
while
so
Im
likely
to
misunderstand.
Yeah...
it
was
noisy
for
a
while.
Minervas
words
spill
over
into
Echidnas
words.
The
blonde
witch
looks
up
at
the
blue
sky
with
a
faint
color
on
her
lovely
face.
Do
you
think
you
can
do
it
well?
Im
really
worried.
I
definitely
refused
I
rejected
my
hand.
Whatever
Im
desperately
trying
to
do
well
it
seems
like
I
havent
given
an
answer
yet.
What
do
you
mean
by
that?
Youre
inviting
yourself
to
shake
off
your
hand
and
youre
trying
to
conceal
even
the
true
intentions
of
me?
It
doesnt
make
sense!
Im
not
trying
to
be
rejected.
Its
just
that
it
doesnt
matter
if
you
are
rejected
or
accepted.
In
response
to
Minervas
angry
shoulders
Echidna
sits
on
the
re-emerged
table.
Then
he
shook
his
finger
to
create
a
teacup
and
steamed
it
into
his
mouth.
I
affirm
my
choice
and
the
consequences
of
my
choice.
I
dont
think
the
consequences
are
a
big
deal.
The
fact
that
I
choose
or
the
fact
that
I
dont
choose
is
important.
Whether
the
result
is
good
or
bad.
Im
proud
that
I
can
enjoy
both
of
them.
But
I
dont
mean
I
dont
have
any
hope.
Next
to
Echidna
which
carries
Donna
tea
in
its
mouth
black-painted
caskets
slowly
line
up.
Daphne
who
settled
in
the
casket
again
devoured
the
sweets
lined
up
on
the
table
like
a
dog
I
say
that
I
respect
the
results
but
I
dont
hesitate
to
guide
the
results
that
I
want
to
see
in
Dona
Dona.
I
dont
hesitate
either
way
but
Im
glad
I
was
here.
Isnt
it
true?
Youre
a
child
who
isnt
interested
in
other
people
but
hes
always
at
the
center
of
it
Daphne
Its
just
that
you
dont
even
have
to
think
about
it
compared
to
the
feeling
of
hunger
that
Daphne
is
worried
about
all
the
time.
Haha
Fumofumo.
Passing
past
the
sweets
sighing
at
Daphne
who
sucks
up
to
the
plate
Echidna
watches
the
other
witches
who
begin
to
sit
on
the
rest
of
the
seats.
I
was
terribly
amazed
I
didnt
hide
my
resentment
and
I
was
amazed-and
only
one
person
was
stubborn.
Tuffon
seems
to
be
quite
angry.
Donna
isnt
refreshing.
Doesnt
it
mean
shes
a
liar?
A
liquor
is
Akunin?
Donna
Akunin?
Im
acting
honestly
about
what
I
want.
I
havent
remembered
lying
yet.
Innocent
Tufons
straightforward
words
Echidna
answers
without
muddy.
The
words
that
Echidna
carried
around
did
not
work
for
the
young
Tuffon.
And
Ekidna
knows
that
if
shes
in
a
bad
mood
its
going
to
jeopardize
everyone
here.
The
condemnation
of
the
punishment
and
the
judgment
of
the
sinner
are
only
part
of
Tufons
power
of
arrogance.
However
when
Tiffons
words
swell
as
if
he
was
convinced
by
the
words
of
Echidna
who
walked
on
such
a
spiritual
tightrope
the
next
low
voice
was
the
witch
buried
in
the
hairball.
Its
not
to
tell
a
lie
its
not
a
lie.
Eh
Kidna-chan
is
really...
awkward
a
child
right?
you
guys……
Echidna
who
is
exposed
to
barrage
frowns
and
the
witches
who
see
it
relax
their
mouths.
Only
Minerva
is
lifting
the
corners
of
the
eyes
while
watching
the
situation.
Minerva
has
been
fighting
for
a
long
time
huh.
It
wasnt
decided
by
all
the
discussion
uh.
I
knew
this
would
happen
if
a
sage
candidate
came...
huh.
Im
sorry
I
know.
Ive
agreed
to
talk
with
you.
But
Im
not
in
a
position
to
be
divisible
like
you
are.
I
want
you
to
understand
that.
Its
normal
to
be
with
Tutyu
I
dont
know
how
to
use
it.
Metome
doesnt
know.
Everyone
is
spending
too
much
life
on
something
other
than
eating
to
live?
Minerva
and
Sekmet
are
together
on
Daphnes
horizontal
spear
and
snort
with
disgust.
It
is
a
tea
party
for
witches
that
is
reasonably
balanced
but
originally
it
was
a
group
of
people
with
a
strong
nature.
It
is
not
uncommon
for
people
to
disagree
with
one
another
and
it
is
often
the
case
that
they
have
a
consensus.
Especially
Minerva
who
poked
against
anyone
and
Sekumeto
who
hated
collision
often
had
a
skirmish.
Each
time
Daphne
who
pokes
the
core
without
reading
the
air
gets
in
the
way.
It
is
always
the
case
that
the
discussion
ends
in
a
fluke.
Minerva
is
angry
Sekmet
is
playing
against
him
Daphne
is
pouring
tea
Carmilla
is
trying
to
prevent
Typhon
from
exploding
Echidna
happily
watches
them-Satella
the
six
are
safe.
Smiling
and
watching.
Its
a
day
Ive
never
had
400
years
ago
and
never
come
again.
Satella
goes
mad
by
the
witch
factor
Minerva
is
trapped
and
mad
Carmilla
burned
down
in
a
great
fire
Daphne
dies
in
the
sandy
sea
Tuffon
is
sunk
in
the
great
water
and
Sekmet
dragons
He
was
slaughtered
and
fell
to
the
waterfall
and
Echidna
gathered
only
their
souls
and
they
were
locked
in
this
world
only
by
their
souls.
Its
an
imperfect
reproduction
of
those
days
that
I
wont
come
back
anymore.
Ekido
Na-chan...
I
wonder
if
you
have
a
sad
face
do
you?
Why?
I
have
no
reason
to
grieve.
You
are
here
and
I
have
the
opportunity
to
get
in
touch
with
the
outside.
Well
isnt
it?
Were...
only
souls
so
its
not
really
us
right?
Im...
Im
dead
now.
So
no
one
can
really
stay
with
Echidna-chan
right?
Echidna
flutters
for
a
moment
at
Carmillas
choppy
words.
-It
is
Echidnas
power
that
gives
them
a
temporary
body
in
the
form
of
a
mental
body
for
those
who
lost
their
bodies
and
became
souls
only.
Prepare
a
vessel
and
let
the
soul
dwell
there.
But
the
souls
were
frozen
at
the
time
they
died
and
nothing
has
changed
since
then.
Is
Carmira
looking
at
Echidna
as
it
really
is
now?
He
is
eliciting
the
reaction
of
his
life
from
his
soul
and
manipulating
his
body
to
perform-Isnt
it
something
of
puppet
play
which
is
caused
by
Echidnas
own
desires?
In
fact
they
share
what
Echidna
knew.
How
can
it
be
said
that
it
is
not
because
their
existence
originates
from
within
Echidna?
――This
is
the
story
after
many
thoughts.
Its
rare
that
you
who
is
a
lump
of
self-love
are
worried
about
me
even
though
hes
a
friend....Isnt
he
too
impressed
by
his
noise
and
humanity?
Well...
I
dont
know...
Echidna-chans...
stupid
In
response
to
Echidnas
deceptive
answer
Carmilla
said
with
a
disappointed
look.
Unexpectedly
Echidna
laughs
with
a
throat
thud.
It
turned
out
that
Echidnas
attitude
turned
towards
the
eyes
of
the
witches
who
had
not
been
aware
of
it.
Echidna
spread
her
hands
Now
the
tea
party
will
be
for
the
witches
for
a
while
again.
He-Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>
probably
wont
be
here
anymore.
Is
that
okay
for
you?
I
dont
want
to
worry
about
loneliness
or
anything
like
that
but
I
didnt
say
anything
at
all
in
the
first
place.
Price...
Ah
that
was
also
there.
Saying
goodbye
to
him
who
is
expected
to
suffer-will
you
laugh
at
me?
With
his
hands
on
his
chin
the
witches
look
at
each
other
as
they
think
about
Echidna.
Then
they
nodded
and
opened
their
mouths
all
at
once
--No
at
all
Oh
I
was
revisited
more
than
I
thought...
Because
you
dont
get
paid
for
it
you
can
just
do
Suketachi.
The
witches
nodded
to
Minerva
with
their
arms
crossed
to
agree.
Echidna
closes
her
eyes
with
her
breath
and
then
clears
her
cough
I
think
there
are
so
many
things
that
we
have
to
talk
to
you
about.
What
do
you
guys
really
think
of
me?
「――――」
Just
well
In
front
of
the
silent
witches
Echidna
drank
the
contents
of
the
cup
and
licked
her
lips
with
her
red
tongue
-Isnt
it
wrong
at
all?
Awakening
came
from
the
feeling
that
something
rough
was
stroking
your
cheek.
When
<@203488399061942272>
noticed
that
his
consciousness
had
risen
he
felt
a
sense
of
fatigue
that
broke
his
entire
body.
The
body
is
so
sluggish
that
I
suspected
that
lead
instead
of
blood
was
poured
into
the
blood
vessels
throughout
the
body.
When
you
open
your
mouth
to
breathe
your
dry
clinging
lips
are
torn
and
with
a
sharp
pain
you
can
taste
the
taste
of
blood
in
your
mouth.
It
was
found
that
in
a
mouth
that
had
even
dried
up
saliva
a
tingling
tongue
crawls
for
water
blood.
My
limbs
are
sluggish
and
my
head
works
poorly
as
if
I
had
a
fever.
I
didnt
even
have
enough
force
to
push
my
eyelids
open
so
I
managed
to
open
my
eyes
by
rolling
a
heavy
eyeball.
When
...You
At
the
moment
when
his
field
of
view
changed
<@203488399061942272>
saw
a
jet-black
color
in
front
of
his
eyes
a
different
color
from
the
back
of
his
eyelids.
While
moving
he
exhaled
the
animal-like
breath
that
is
peculiar
to
animals
but
kept
licking
his
cheek
with
his
tongue
as
if
to
work
on
sleeping
<@203488399061942272>.
A
slender
jet-black
body
with
a
slender
and
sophisticated
form.
Its
sharp
but
somehow
charming
reptiles
eyes
like
a
knife-like
fang
that
could
make
you
a
Buddha
in
one
shot
if
you
bite
it.
Was
a
love
dragon
Patrasche.
When
Patrasch
realizes
that
<@203488399061942272>
has
perceived
herself
Patrash
stops
sitting
and
waits
for
words.
The
surprisingly
clever
Earth
Dragon
can
fold
its
knees
and
sit
there.
Looking
at
Patrasche
in
front
<@203488399061942272>
realizes
that
he
is
leaning
against
something
hard
and
throwing
his
feet
to
the
ground.
If
you
tilt
your
head
and
look
back
you
can
see
the
mossy
stone
wall
behind
and
familiar
to
you
near
the
entrance
to
the
grave.
Im
sure...
why?
As
usual
it
is
customary
to
wake
up
from
the
dream
castle
from
the
graveyard.
Of
course
unless
someone
pulls
out
an
unconscious
<@203488399061942272>
there
is
only
two
people
Emilia
and
Garfir
can
put
in
the
grave
in
the
current
sanctuary.
It
was
simply
unrealistic
that
either
of
them
took
<@203488399061942272>
out.
But
I
dont
think
Ive
crawled
out
by
myself
at
all...
Who
tries
to
keep
saying
it
is
interrupted
by
another
voice
that
echoes.
In
the
distance
there
was
a
silhouette
of
a
man
rushing
out
from
behind
Patrasche
who
was
out
of
breath
tending
to
tangle
his
legs
as
he
approached
Oh!
Patarush
hey...
wait...!
Hii
Hii..
But
if
theres
something
I
can
get
away
with
whats
the
problem
with
me...?
Its
the
gray-haired
young
man-Otto
who
finds
Patraches
appearance
and
stops
with
a
truly
relieved
face.
He
took
a
breather
at
Patrache
and
noticed
<@203488399061942272>
beside
him
and
leaned
his
head.
Isnt
it
Natsuki-san?
What
are
you
doing
in
such
a
place?
If
you
look
at
it
you
know
its
a
moonlight
bath.
What
did
you
do
in
such
a
late
night.
In
some
cases
Ill
stick
to
the
garfeel.
I
dont
know
why
I
did
something
wrong
but
Natsuki-san
isnt
irrelevant
when
I
sweat
on
my
forehead
at
such
a
time.
<@203488399061942272>
who
turns
lightly
when
Otto
manages
to
maintain
his
normal
appearance.
Otto
shrugged
in
response
to
<@203488399061942272>s
words
and
shook
his
head
saying
Oh
my
god!
Isnt
it
unrelated
to
me?
Its
so
noisy
so
when
I
went
to
see
the
stables
of
the
earth
dragon
Patrasche
made
a
noise.
I
wondered
if
there
was
something
maybe
I
was
trapped
for
a
few
days
so
I
was
stressed
and
the
fastener
If
I
take
it
off
and
give
me
a
light
walk...
Including
the
action
of
clapping
his
hands
Otto
glares
at
Patrasches
noble
profile.
However
Patrasche
is
unresponsive
to
Otto
and
just
stares
at
<@203488399061942272>.
I
dont
think
its
completely
in
my
eyes.
No
but
I
rushed
me
out
of
the
stable.
I
was
observing
for
a
while
but
I
was
able
to
escape
outside
like
this.
After
that
I
was
really
impatient
with
the
situation
and
now
I
am
here.
I
was
relieved
because
I
was
here.
Yes
yes.
Natsuki-san
did
you
instruct
Patrasche-chan?
I
dont
have
that
kind
of
time.
I
couldnt
show
my
face
except
to
go
for
dinner...
If
not
I
was
worried.
I
just
came
out
in
a
hurry.
「――――」
Ottos
murmur
made
him
worried
and
<@203488399061942272>
argued
that
his
throat
was
blocked.
Suddenly
the
feeling
of
a
sudden
rise
and
<@203488399061942272>
checks
his
physical
condition
for
evidence.
Immediately
the
trace
was
found.
The
right
shoulder
part
of
the
jacket
the
traces
of
saliva
that
were
slightly
recessed
with
a
tooth
pattern.
And
on
the
back
side
of
<@203488399061942272>s
body
dust
was
heavily
polluted
as
if
dragged.
Patrache...
「――――」
My
flat
eyes
are
turned
to
<@203488399061942272>.
<@203488399061942272>
suddenly
took
a
breath
of
breath
as
she
waited
for
the
land
dragon
to
silence
her
words
Did
you
pull
me
out
of
the
grave?
Of
course
Patrasche
cannot
respond
to
<@203488399061942272>s
questions
in
words.
However
<@203488399061942272>
was
conscious
of
the
dirt
on
his
body
and
looked
at
the
earth
dragon
and
noticed
that
the
jet-black
skin
had
multiple
lacerations.
It
is
not
easy
to
use
a
tool
to
damage
the
skin
of
a
ground
dragon
covered
with
hard
scales.
Above
all
the
wound
appeared
to
<@203488399061942272>s
eyes
as
if
it
had
originated
from
inside
the
body.
I
suddenly
remember.
--The
graveyard
has
the
ability
to
bounce
off
those
who
do
not
qualify
for
the
trial.
The
wounds
of
Roswar
who
heal
in
the
sleeping
room
start
from
there
if
the
cause
is
corrected.
If
an
unqualified
person
steps
into
it
the
grave
will
peel
its
fangs
on
the
unreachable--
Did
you
get
hurt
like
that
to
take
me
out?
「――――」
Why
that
stupid
imitation...
apart
from
me
when
I
wake
up
I
usually
come
out
from
the
inside
and
thats
it.
You
dont
have
to
rush
out
to
get
hurt.
Even
though...
The
lacerations
engraved
on
Patrasches
skin
are
so
sharp
that
the
red
flesh
underneath
the
black
skin
can
be
seen
lightly
and
the
bloody
bleeding
that
is
painful
enough
to
make
you
frown
just
by
looking.
And
Patrasch
took
<@203488399061942272>
out
to
the
point
of
being
hurt
so
much-its
definitely
a
wasteful
act.
Uncertain
what
Patrache
did
Jiryu
sneaks
at
<@203488399061942272>s
blinding
eyes.
A
tight
rough
feel
was
rubbed
against
the
neck
of
<@203488399061942272>
who
still
threw
his
legs
out.
The
communication
of
the
thoughts
that
I
thought
that
I
could
sometimes
do
was
a
one-way
street
without
words
and
it
is
a
relationship
that
has
only
been
cared
for
in
various
situations.
Otto
And
what?
Right
now
it
looks
like
its
a
nice
atmosphere
so
Im
trying
not
to
bother
you...
Why
Patrasche
tried
to
help
me...
ask
me.
Otto
has
protection
of
Kotodama
and
should
be
able
to
talk
to
different
creatures
such
as
animals
and
insects.
Naturally
he
should
be
able
to
communicate
with
Patrasche.
What
did
Patrache
think
and
wanted
to
take
out
<@203488399061942272>
until
he
was
injured-the
root
of
it
didnt
bother
me
now.
However
Otto
at
the
request
of
<@203488399061942272>
bends
his
lips
and
makes
a
disgusting
look.
Honestly
I
cant
go
on
Natsuki-san.
Dont
say
so
ask.
I
think
from
the
muttering
of
Patrasche-chan
now
Natsuki-san
this
trial
might
have
been
in
a
graveyard.
Its
hard
to
understand
that
Natsuki-san
is
entitled
to
the
trial
in
the
daytime.
Im
sorry
but
that
kind
of
thing
failed?
...Oh
yes.
The
memory
of
the
interaction
with
the
witches
is
so
strong
that
my
memory
is
becoming
vague
but
in
this
loop
<@203488399061942272>
does
not
tell
everyone
that
he
has
surpassed
the
first
trial.
Exceptionally
unveiled
to
Garfeel
enter
the
grave
with
his
feet
and
the
second
trial
is
the
Witchs
Tea
Party.
The
reason
for
being
overwhelmed
is
not
just
the
trial
but
I
dont
even
think
of
a
reason
to
correct
Ottos
mistake
<@203488399061942272>
pulls
his
chin
as
he
hears
it.
When
Otto
dropped
his
shoulder
on
<@203488399061942272>
he
sighed
openly
as
he
was
disappointed.
The
reason
for
doing
that
is
quite
speculative...
but
I
was
stupid
Natsuki-san.
In
addition
I
had
a
painful
eye
in
the
inside
and
I
am
worried
about
Airyu
as
it
is
now.
Patrache-chan
I
think
youve
noticed
something
happened
to
Natsuki-san
because
he
has
a
good
intuition
so
you
can
blow
me
away
and
rush
here...
the
wounds
arent
irrelevant.
「――――」
Otto
who
traces
the
same
flow
as
the
previous
<@203488399061942272>
imagination
and
reaches
the
conclusion.
So
far
<@203488399061942272>
has
arrived.
The
problem
is
one
reason
why
Patrasche
has
done
so.
I
want
Otto
to
hear
that
What
is
that
eye?
No
way
isnt
your
story
really
serious?
On
the
contrary
do
I
look
like
I
can
make
a
joke
now?
I
think
Natsuki
had
the
spirit
of
being
able
to
make
a
joke
that
was
tattered
and
it
would
be
more
laughable
to
hear
that
it
was
a
joke
in
this
situation.
-Isnt
it
really
true?
Interrogated
in
a
low
voice
<@203488399061942272>
is
overwhelmed
by
Ottos
gaze
before
he
argues.
Otto
is
looking
down
on
<@203488399061942272>
with
an
incredible
look
or
perhaps
an
idiot.
I
wonder
if
there
is
a
grand
oversight
in
<@203488399061942272>.
However
<@203488399061942272>
who
is
stumbling
around
has
no
imaginable
clause
and
just
confuses
his
eyebrows.
The
feeling
of
impatience
makes
the
forehead
even
sweat
but
no
thoughts
come
to
mind.
Otto
sighed
for
the
second
time
“Mr.
Natsuki
thinks
that
my
blessing
is
not
all-purpose.
Even
if
I
can
communicate
it
is
not
translated.
It
is
clearly
transmitted
to
me
but
through
me
Its
difficult
to
tell
someone
because
of
nuance
issues.
「――――」
Its
still
good
to
do
it.
Its
okay...
I
wonder
if
theres
a
meaning
to
do
this.
Otto
reluctantly
listens
to
<@203488399061942272>s
request
even
as
he
hurts
and
complains.
When
Otto
gently
pats
his
black
back
as
he
walks
up
to
Patrache
who
is
still
leaning
on
<@203488399061942272>
『――――』
Ottos
throat
with
open
mouth
emits
a
high-pitched
blurred
voice.
It
cannot
be
a
human
language.
It
is
a
call
that
has
been
transformed
into
a
form
most
suitable
for
communicating
with
the
Earth
Dragon
as
a
result
of
the
work
of
protection
of
the
spirit
of
God.
Patrasche
who
raises
his
face
also
sways
and
responds
to
Otto.
Hearing
that
Otto
opened
his
mouth
again
and
after
several
exchanges
Its
over
but...
well
its
hard
to
say
well.
Its
different
from
humans
because
of
how
they
express
emotions
so
how
do
you
explain
what
I
understand
only...
Dont
panic.
Ill
ask
please
tell
me.
Im
impatient...
Ah
Im
really
in
trouble!
I
mean
Im
kind
of
weird
to
convey
this
though.
Scratching
his
head
Otto
pondered
his
face
a
few
times
looked
down
again
repeated
his
thoughts
and
finally
when
<@203488399061942272>
sat
down
and
started
poverty
squirming
he
finally
exhaled.
Yeah.
Well
maybe
I
chose
the
word
that
was
closest
to
me.
Oh...
what
is
Patrasche?
Well
dont
you
let
me
say
that?
--Ah?
<@203488399061942272>s
eyes
turn
to
Ottos
words
as
she
cheeks
on
her
cheeks
and
smells.
Ill
just
wait
for
him
to
say
something
else
but
theres
no
way
that
more
words
will
come
out.
Otto
said
to
<@203488399061942272>
who
was
taken
aback
Patrash
said
Dont
let
me
say
that.
Well
I
suppose
it
should
be.
Dont
let
me
say
that...what...
It
doesnt
matter
what
you
say
or
what
you
say.
If
I
add
my
opinion
I
need
to
be
told
is
it
like
this?
Otto
puts
one
finger
in
front
of
Subject?
``As
soon
as
I
knew
that
person
was
in
trouble
I
couldnt
help
but
jump
out
lend
me
a
hand
willing
to
hurt
myself
and
stayed
with
me
until
I
woke
up
and
woke
up.
Laughing
at
ease
when
I
see-I
think
that
its
the
same
whether
its
a
human
or
a
ground
dragon
how
I
think
of
someone
who
does
this
kind
of
thing.
Ah--
Then
even
if
youre
not
Patrasche-chan
youll
say
Dont
make
me
say
that.
Dont
you
pass
the
insensitivity
by
showing
your
attitude
like
this?
Isnt
it
happy?
Hearing
Ottos
frightening
answer
<@203488399061942272>
realizes
that
he
is
stupid.
Then
when
I
looked
at
Patrache
in
the
immediate
vicinity
Jiryu
was
gazing
at
<@203488399061942272>
with
a
constant
gaze
and
I
wonder
if
I
noticed
this
change
in
my
mind
I
shake
my
long
tail
and
stand
up
「――――」
Again
Patrasches
nose
moved
and
<@203488399061942272>s
hand
naturally
stroked.
While
stroking
his
hard
rocky
skin
with
his
palm
<@203488399061942272>
has
a
trembling
voice
Well...
you
do
you
like
me?
「――――」
Do
you
like
me
are
you
right?
I
had
a
feeling
that
something
I
had
in
my
chest
fell
off.
Patrache
ridiculed
to
<@203488399061942272>s
words
and
filed
<@203488399061942272>s
palm
with
his
nose
violently
as
if
to
be
blindfolded.
<@203488399061942272>
is
trying
to
open
her
mouth
while
looking
at
the
feeling
that
the
skin
is
scraped
Ohhh...
Mr.
Natsuki?
Suddenly
a
hot
drop
came
down
on
<@203488399061942272>s
cheek.
Its
tears.
What
was
suddenly
spilled
into
a
place
where
I
wasnt
aware
of
it.
I
hurriedly
wiped
it
with
my
hand
but
it
was
too
late
to
hide
it.
It
has
been
seen
by
Otto.
Crying
realizing
that
Im
fond
of
the
Earth
Dragon
Natsuki-san...
No...
its
wrong
now...
But
just
because
the
timings
were
messing
with
each
other...
shit
the
answer
suddenly
jumped
into
a
place
where
I
didnt
really
feel
that
much
Is
ready...
As
cowardly
<@203488399061942272>
desperately
endures
things
that
are
still
crowded
in
the
timely
development.
At
the
witchs
tea
party
<@203488399061942272>
realized
his
true
intention
of
not
wanting
to
die.
I
want
to
be
with
my
loved
ones
as
much
as
I
want
to
protect
my
loved
ones.
And
I
just
vowed
to
see
how
difficult
it
is
to
realize
that
Im
worth
being
saved
by
the
people
I
love.
Come
there
and
its
Patraches
free
loyalty.
What
should
I
do
if
you
imitate
me
like
this
before
taking
action
from
here?
Patrasche
woke
up
with
the
answer
that
<@203488399061942272>
was
worried
about
and
was
wondering
what
to
do.
At
least
for
Patrasche
<@203488399061942272>
is
so
influential
that
he
realizes
that
he
has
a
nightmare
and
wants
to
take
him
out
even
if
he
is
hurt.
No
way
I
didnt
expect
to
learn
from
you
first.-Thanks
Patrasche.
<@203488399061942272>
also
emotionally
pats
the
Patrasche
as
he
responds
to
the
loyalty
directed.
Satisfying
the
feel
of
the
palm
Patrache
resolutely
stretches
his
back
and
stands
up.
However
the
swaying
tail
movement
was
a
subtle
indication
of
her
good
mood.
Is
it
OK
to
reconfirm
the
bond
with
Patrache-chan
Natsuki-san?
Oh
thank
you
so
much.
What
is
all
right?
Then
its
your
body
and
head.
The
trial
in
the
middle
is
pretty
complicated.
Its
about
crying
because
of
a
persons
love
and
Emilia
was
like
that.
I
wanted
to
argue
with
the
ridiculous
words
but
<@203488399061942272>
didnt
mention
that
part
because
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
had
a
weakness.
Instead
thinking
about
Ottos
voice
of
Emilia
Its
not
easy
but
Im
probably
better
than
Emilia
receives
it.
Even
so
you
worry
about
me...
maybe
you
like
me
too?
Why
dont
you
say
something
unpleasant!?
I
wonder
Im
missed.
Im
not
too
tired
of
Patrache-chan
and
Im
not
willing
to
listen
to
everyone
I
meet
right?
Isnt
that
right?
To
be
honest
Im
on
the
verge
of
being
able
to
affirm
myself
so
Id
like
to
receive
as
many
messages
of
encouragement
as
possible.
Yes
yeah
Im
glad
that
my
usual
tone
is
coming
back...
Im
just
worried
about
Natsuki-san
because
Im
concerned
about
future
relationships
so
dont
get
me
wrong.
Otto
turned
his
both
hands
away
and
said
while
making
a
disgusting
look
at
<@203488399061942272>s
eccentric
notice.
Its
a
shameful
expression
to
consider
the
relationship
but
it
is
a
necessary
statement
for
him
who
wants
to
clarify
his
position
as
a
merchant.
Im
going
to
associate
with
Natsuki-san
because
I
want
to
maintain
a
good
relationship
with
the
Maesars
Frontier
Count.
If
there
seems
to
be
a
problem
there
or
something
that
would
pose
a
danger
to
me
in
the
first
place
quickly
escape.
Ill
let
you
know
and
remember
only
that.
Speaking
of
pitifulness
is
a
pitiful
remark
but
it
was
more
of
an
implicit
understanding
for
each
other
than
severe.
The
point
where
I
dare
to
say
that
is
because
it
represents
the
Otto
persons
preference
and
even
now.
Oh
yes.
You...
no.
Subsequent
to
the
Ottos
realist
statement
<@203488399061942272>
nods
and
stops.
The
discomfort
of
the
back
of
my
chest
that
I
heard
with
his
present
introductory
feeling.
Soon
after
finding
the
answer
<@203488399061942272>
exhaled.
...
what?
Nmm
I
remember.
Oh
it
was.
Nodded
many
times
to
Otto
with
a
suspicious
face
<@203488399061942272>
put
his
hand
on
his
head
and
looked
up
at
the
sky.
In
the
loop
starting
from
this
sanctuary
<@203488399061942272>
worked
with
Otto
many
times.
And
each
time
<@203488399061942272>
watched.
So
<@203488399061942272>
looks
at
Otto
If
youre
at
risk
youll
be
staring...
Yes
of
course.
Isnt
it
obvious?
There
is
no
reason
for
me
to
justify
Natsuki-san
or
other
people
to
that
extent.
Its
a
life-threatening
thing...
You
wont
run
away
--e
<@203488399061942272>
murmured
as
Otto
tried
to
pretend
to
be
a
realist
with
a
lighter
tone.
And
to
Otto
with
his
eyes
round
<@203488399061942272>
turned
straight
ahead
and
said.
-You
dont
run
away
with
me
Otto.
In
the
past
he
sneaked
into
Garfields
hideout
where
he
took
a
violent
stance
to
help
<@203488399061942272>.
And
in
order
to
protect
<@203488399061942272>
from
the
threat
of
the
beastified
Garfir
he
resisted
to
stop
with
the
villagers.
<@203488399061942272>
knows
he
doesnt
look
like
a
villain
even
if
he
puts
up
frail
words.
So
Otto.
-Because
you
are
my
friend.

Encouraged
by
Otto
and
Patrasche
one
and
one
<@203488399061942272>
was
saved
from
a
predicament.
To
be
honest
there
are
many
things
that
I
havent
swallowed
yet
but
I
have
to
break
them
down
one
by
one
and
use
them
as
my
own
food.
First
I
cant
get
Echidnas
cooperation
anymore...
Echidna
the
greedy
witch
was
watching
<@203488399061942272>
scratching
his
feet
wearing
a
skin
that
was
friendly
to
<@203488399061942272>.
Its
not
all
that
much
but
I
want
to
think
now
after
the
last
exchange
but
it
is
a
creature
called
a
witch
who
cant
bend
its
principles.
I
was
keenly
aware
of
the
other
five
witches-Sekmet
Daphne
Carmilla
Tufon
and
Minerva.
They
were
by
no
means
subversive
in
the
eyes
of
<@203488399061942272>.
However
it
cannot
be
said
that
there
is
goodness
even
if
the
mouth
is
torn.
This
is
true
even
for
Minerva
whose
principle
is
to
heal
people.
The
attitude
of
throwing
everything
away
to
heal
others
while
losing
their
own
limbs
was
more
marked
by
fierceness
than
by
nobility.
And
the
last
witch
Satella-I
want
to
think
about
her
later.
The
incomprehensible
feeling
that
I
felt
for
Satella
rising
from
the
inside
of
<@203488399061942272>.
It
was
instinctual
to
understand
that
answering
those
questions
was
dangerous
more
than
I
could
afford
in
the
current
<@203488399061942272>
situation.
The
last
words
I
exchanged
at
the
time
of
parting.
And
at
the
last
look
of
Satella-just
remembering
it
<@203488399061942272>s
chest
is
about
to
be
torn
by
being
scolded
by
crazy
emotions
from
the
inside.
Therefore
<@203488399061942272>
devotes
himself
to
another
problem
avoiding
consciously
thinking
about
Satella.
That
is
Echidnas
last
piece
of
advice
and
whether
or
not
Satellas
words
should
be
taken
for
granted.
Its
nice
to
say
that
I
take
care
of
myself...
Relative
to
Satella
the
overlapping
of
the
first
and
second
trials
at
the
grave
and
the
fact
that
people
who
<@203488399061942272>
doesnt
want
him
to
die
for
will
also
mourn
<@203488399061942272>s
death.
I
knew
――I
realized
that
I
didnt
want
to
die.
But
what
do
you
do
with
it?
The
fact
that
there
are
few
weapons
available
has
not
changed.
The
fact
that
too
many
problems
have
not
been
solved
has
not
changed.
On
the
contrary
the
number
of
people
who
can
rely
on
the
solution
has
decreased.
My
heart
has
been
slightly
rebuilt
but
the
rest
of
the
world
is
moving
backward
rather
than
moving
forward.
Trust
someone
who
cares
for
me...
what
should
I
do...
Does
it
mean
that
you
can
confide
and
rely
on
it?
However
it
is
none
other
than
Satella
who
bans
it-No
if
you
follow
the
conversation
flow
in
that
place
it
is
the
personality
of
the
jealous
witch
who
bans
<@203488399061942272>
from
returning
to
death
Will
it
be?
Does
Satella
have
a
different
claim
from
another
personality?
What
does
the
last
call
mean?
So
thats
not
the
point
right
now.
Thinking
about
to
flow
towards
Satella
the
brakes
are
applied.
What
is
needed
is
a
concrete
solution
to
each
problem
its
presentation
and
consideration.
Garfeel
is
afraid
of
the
outside
world...
It
was
the
last
piece
of
advice
Echidna
gave
and
the
information
he
gave
me
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
break
the
situation.
Girfeels
first
trial
in
the
past
may
have
already
been
confessed
by
his
attitude
and
will
Echidnas
words
complement
it?
The
question
is
what
did
he
see
in
the
past
and
became
afraid
of
the
outside
world?
The
fact
that
Frederica
tried
to
leave
the
sanctuary
because
she
was
annoyed
at
the
Roswar
mansion
was
probably
not
unrelated
to
the
trauma.
I
dont
think
its
a
problem
that
asks
questions
from
the
front
and
asks
them
to
speak
honestly.
When
that
happens
I
would
have
to
know
and
hear
from
the
other
person...
but
Frederica
and
Liu-san
seemed
to
have
a
heavy
mouth...
Frederica
couldnt
chase
Garfield
in
the
grave
if
she
believed
in
her
own
words
and
as
a
result
she
seemed
to
be
in
a
position
where
she
didnt
know
the
content
of
Trials.
On
the
contrary
the
crown
who
jumped
in
and
brought
back
Garfield
can
be
considered
to
have
experienced
one
of
the
replicas
being
tried.
Perhaps
you
probably
know
the
content
of
the
trials
that
Garfir
saw.
When
that
happens
I
dont
want
to
do
it
too
much...
but
is
it
certain
that
Ill
get
command
of
the
crystal
of
Lew
Meyer
and
ask
me
to
break
it?
Even
the
crown
who
is
the
representative
of
the
sanctuary
which
is
the
leader
of
the
reproduction
said
that
he
could
not
resist
the
existence
of
control.
There
is
a
compulsory
force
to
execute
it
even
if
it
goes
against
your
will.
Even
in
the
sense
that
you
can
get
more
than
20
collaborators
there
should
be
more
value
in
doing
it
than
getting
information.
Yes
I
want
to
convince
myself.
「――――」
In
the
mind
of
<@203488399061942272>
is
a
burning
sanctuary
and
a
flock
of
white
rabbits.
Desperate
to
escape
from
it
it
is
a
shallow
memory
that
protected
himself
by
squeezing
the
replica
crowns
one
after
another.
I
have
to
run
under
Emilia.
Using
that
as
the
cause
<@203488399061942272>
eagerly
ordered
the
crowns
and
rushed
to
the
grave
while
he
was
completely
wounded.
Since
then
I
have
neither
omitted
nor
regretted
what
I
did
at
that
time
but
when
I
return
calmly
it
is
scary
for
me
to
see
how
frivolous
it
was.
This
is
even
more
true
now
that
I
have
become
aware
of
my
cuteness
if
I
do
not
want
to
die.
Perhaps
more
arrogantly
and
straightforwardly
I
would
let
them
throw
their
lives
out.
Even
though
I
didnt
want
to
do
that
I
couldnt
trust
myself.
My
head
is
messed
up...
Im
overkill
for
the
negative
shit.
Im
thinking
about
it
all
over
so
Im
going
over
the
capacity
of
my
brain.
Ill
crush
each
one
where
I
can
crush
it.
The
problem
where
questions
and
answers
are
directly
connected.
You
should
start
by
putting
them
one
at
a
time
and
then
connect
the
problems
that
have
been
answered
to
a
solution
to
a
larger
problem.
For
the
time
being
<@203488399061942272>
looks
for
a
problem
that
seems
to
be
upward.
First
The
liberation
of
the
sanctuary
this
is
the
end
of
the
first
trial
and
I
should
do
it.
There
is
no
need
to
burden
Emilia
any
more.
Or
if
too
much
pressure
puts
Emilias
mental
state
Its
going
to
be
a
tough
job.
In
the
snow-covered
sanctuary
Emilia
is
reminiscent
of
the
love
of
<@203488399061942272>.
It
is
self-evident
that
Emilia
will
become
ah
as
a
result
of
her
heartbreaking
after
trying
the
trials.
Continuing
to
face
the
trial
does
not
lead
to
good
results.
If
I
had
to
clear
the
trial...
My
next
question
was
the
second
trial.
I
was
quite
patient...
but
was
it
supposed
to
be
cleared
in
the
first
place?
Its
unthinkable
now-a
world
where
different
choices
are
made
under
such
a
name.
It
was
the
second
trial
that
allowed
you
to
experience
the
so-called
parallel
world.
The
trials
where
you
can
feel
the
world
lines
different
from
the
original
flow
in
a
pseudo
manner
may
have
been
a
mere
parallel
world
for
people
other
than
<@203488399061942272>.
However
only
for
<@203488399061942272>
Trial
stripped
its
fangs
in
the
original
sense.
In
the
form
of
showing
the
future
of
<@203488399061942272>s
wrong
worlds.
There
were
various
forms
of
regret
various
tragic
consequences
and
various
mournings
in
memory
of
<@203488399061942272>s
death.
<@203488399061942272>s
heart
shattered
into
pieces
when
he
tasted
them
with
his
eyes
and
skin.
Even
now
I
cant
help
but
feel
cold
sensations
all
over
my
body
and
the
feeling
of
numbness
in
my
limbs.
Then
when
I
was
screaming
in
my
heart
I
was
taken
to
the
castle
of
dreams-what
was
the
actual
problem
what
was
the
trial?
There
is
no
doubt
that
it
cannot
be
said
that
it
has
cleared.
However
unlike
the
case
of
the
first
trial
I
had
no
idea
how
to
complete
the
second
trial.
Even
if
youre
worried
theres
no
way...
I
have
to
do
what
I
can
do.
Shaking
his
head
<@203488399061942272>
pushes
up
the
confused
heart
and
stands
up.
It
is
the
darkness
of
the
entrance
that
puts
your
hand
on
the
wall
of
the
graveyard
on
your
back
and
gazes
at
it.
Only
one
<@203488399061942272>
was
thinking
about
and
Patrash
and
Otto
who
were
worried
about
<@203488399061942272>
before
are
not
on
their
side.
The
last
interaction
made
me
ridiculous
and
embarrassed
so
I
asked
Otto
to
pull
Patrasche
back
to
the
stable.
Until
the
end
I
felt
that
the
feelings
from
Patrasche
who
worried
about
<@203488399061942272>
could
be
saved
but
I
needed
one
time
to
put
together
various
thoughts.
The
main
issues
that
need
to
be
dealt
with
are
the
sanctuary
and
the
mansion.
The
sanctuary
is
trial
and
garfield
and
rabbit.
The
manor
is
Beatrice
and
Elsa....
All
of
them
are
depressed
by
the
difficulties
that
have
not
been
found
yet.
However
I
cannot
afford
to
be
depressed.
Steal
the
problems
one
by
one.
Do
not
think
that
you
have
an
idea
that
it
is
a
disposable
life.
First
confirm
the
trial.
If
the
second
trial
begins
it
is
good
and
if
the
third
trial
begins
because
it
is
over
it
is
better.
At
least
the
situation
will
move
significantly
if
the
barrier
is
released
sooner.
Garfir
will
also
have
to
think
about
how
to
move
and
at
worst
it
will
be
possible
to
evacuate
even
if
a
rabbit
comes
in.
As
expected
it
is
hard
to
imagine
that
Garfeel
will
continue
to
hold
on
to
the
threat
of
the
rabbit.
The
sanctuary
problem
is
likely
to
be
resolved
by
breaking
the
barrier.
Thinking
that
far
<@203488399061942272>
feels
relieved
that
a
thin
glow
has
opened
up
in
front
of
him.
He
was
suffering
from
a
number
of
head-scratching
problems
but
at
least
it
seemed
like
a
path
to
the
answer.
「――――」
Stand
at
the
entrance
to
the
grave
and
take
a
breather
in
front
of
the
stone
passageway
that
can
be
seen
beyond
the
darkness.
If
you
go
inside
and
the
trial
begins
you
may
face
the
unprecedented
present
again.
For
<@203488399061942272>
that
spectacle
never
gets
used
to
it.
But
we
know
that
we
cannot
afford
to
ignore
or
forget.
If
you
cant
escape
you
have
no
choice
but
to
challenge.
<@203488399061942272>
takes
a
deep
breath
then
holds
his
breath
and
moves
his
foot
forward.
Stepping
into
the
grave
and
trying
the
trial
to
release
the
sanctuary
-------!?
Immediately
after
stepping
on
<@203488399061942272>
shook
the
sensation
of
suddenly
hitting
the
skull.
I
had
a
needle-sticking
pain
directly
in
my
brain
and
my
feet
became
unclear
at
the
moment
when
I
thought
that
light
was
scattered
in
front
of
me.
The
whole
upper
body
shook
and
<@203488399061942272>
couldnt
stand
so
much
that
he
fell
into
place.
Severe
nausea
engulfed
and
gastric
juice
spilled
into
the
pain
that
squeezed
the
contents
of
the
stomach.
I
coughed
but
I
didnt
get
any
better
after
repeated.
A
bell
a
bell
a
bell
is
ringing.
<@203488399061942272>
rolls
while
panting
due
to
the
chain
of
discomfort
and
dissonance
that
surrounds
her
body
and
leaves
the
graveyard.
Instinctively
thought.
If
you
step
inside
and
if
you
go
deeper
the
malice
that
erodes
this
body
will
become
even
more
fierce.
Uh...
Geh...
huh
huh
huh
Rolling
out
of
the
grave
<@203488399061942272>
holds
his
hand
on
the
grassland
and
repeats
vomiting.
As
soon
as
the
body
is
completely
separated
from
the
grave
the
suffering
that
<@203488399061942272>
had
been
suffering
from
before
goes
away.
Headache
feeling
of
vomiting
numbness
of
limbs
faded
<@203488399061942272>s
eyes
raised
his
face
Ah...
what
are
you
doing
now...?
Looking
at
the
entrance
to
the
grave
and
reaching
for
it
to
crawl
towards
it
a
root
of
refusal
rises
inside
<@203488399061942272>.
It
is
not
a
trauma
that
fears
the
contents
of
the
“trial”
or
a
problem
of
that
dimension.
--You
can
clearly
see
that
the
grave
has
been
rejected.
Nah...
Knowing
that
he
was
being
refused
<@203488399061942272>
quickly
realized
what
had
happened
to
him.
Patrache
stepped
in
to
take
out
<@203488399061942272>
and
was
injured.
Roswar
was
also
seriously
injured
when
he
entered
the
grave
to
try
Trial.
The
grave
rejects
those
who
are
not
qualified
to
challenge
the
Trials.
What
if
that
effect
was
demonstrated
in
<@203488399061942272>?
That
should
be...
because
it
is...
Standing
up
and
fluttering
<@203488399061942272>
bravely
challenges
the
grave.
However
the
moment
he
stepped
in
the
headache
and
nausea
returned
again
and
he
crushed
<@203488399061942272>
with
an
overwhelming
negative
sensation
that
he
could
not
even
stand.
Hah...
huh
huh...
Later
while
breathing
roughly
away
from
the
entrance
to
the
grave
<@203488399061942272>
admitted
the
facts
he
had
learned
from
his
current
challenge.
That
wickedness...
In
my
mind
is
a
white-haired
witch
in
a
mourning
dress.
When
she
parted
she
certainly
asked
<@203488399061942272>:
Choose
whether
to
take
your
own
hand
or
Satellas
hand.
And
<@203488399061942272>
took
Satellas
hand
instead
of
Echidnas.
If
the
return
to
the
deed
is
this
its
too--.
“The
light
that
looked
like………!”
At
the
end
of
the
day
I
thought
that
I
was
just
giving
the
hint
only
by
favor
and
I
was
thinking
that
I
should
revisit
it.
-Im
not
wrong
at
all
right?
<@203488399061942272>
looked
up
at
the
night
sky
hearing
the
witch-like
voice
of
a
witch
that
could
not
be
heard
Disqualification...
I
dont
ask
Echidna!!
--Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>
has
lost
the
qualification
to
challenge
the
trial
to
release
the
sanctuary
Isnt
it
because
of
the
mistake
or
something
wrong...
After
touching
the
crystal
in
front
of
him
and
seeing
no
signs
of
it
<@203488399061942272>
pressed
his
forehead
against
the
hard
cold
crystal
and
spilled
lamentably.
A
girl
sleeps
in
a
crystal-the
original
Crown
Meyer
does
not
respond
to
<@203488399061942272>s
lament.
To
begin
with
she
never
goes
to
Ebaras
sleep
and
responds
to
<@203488399061942272>s
call
but
apart
from
that
the
desired
reaction
does
not
occur.
That
is
Because
I
was
taken
up
by
the
qualification
even
if
I
touched
the
crystal
the
authority
to
direct
the
copy
of
Mr.
Crown
was
not
delegated...
The
power
to
control
the
copy
of
Crown
Meyer
can
only
be
possessed
by
the
Apostle
of
Greed.
<@203488399061942272>
who
rejected
Echidna
and
was
deprived
of
her
qualifications
for
the
trial
of
the
grave
would
have
been
judged
unworthy
of
that
role.
Upon
entering
this
facility
where
air
can
enter
which
makes
the
chest
unpleasant
<@203488399061942272>
is
holding
on
to
the
feeling
that
the
light
that
should
have
been
seen
is
moving
away.
Worst
really
worst
you
could
think
that
the
trauma
of
showing
the
second
“trial”
until
he
confirms
this
is
causing
<@203488399061942272>
to
hesitate
to
step
into
the
grave.
If
thats
the
reason
<@203488399061942272>s
heart
is
at
stake.
He
could
have
tried
many
times
in
rough
medical
treatment
and
healed
his
weak
heart.
However
if
things
are
beyond
the
reach
of
<@203488399061942272>
its
a
good
idea.
The
fact
that
you
cant
even
go
into
the
grave
means
that
you
cant
even
talk
directly
to
Echidna
to
requalify.
Before
that
I
could
instinctively
understand
whether
or
not
the
witches
who
did
parting
would
appear
again
in
front
of
<@203488399061942272>.
And
understanding
that
means
that
<@203488399061942272>s
eyes
to
break
through
the
trials
have
disappeared
and
the
release
of
the
sanctuary
is
left
to
the
hands
other
than
<@203488399061942272>.
I
mean
Do
you
want
Emilia
to
do
that...?
Renewing
her
most
feared
situation
<@203488399061942272>
wants
to
swear
by
Echidnas
bad
habits.
Echidna
was
able
to
read
<@203488399061942272>s
memory.
Only
she
should
have
been
able
to
observe
<@203488399061942272>s
repeating
world
in
the
same
way.
So
Echidna
should
have
known
Emilia
who
collapsed
after
being
challenged
alone
and
collapsed.
I
should
have
known
that
<@203488399061942272>
was
desperate
to
avoid
it
and
was
running
down.
Still
is
The
Greedy
Witch
tough
on
<@203488399061942272>
and
Emilia?
What
to
do
what
to
do
what
to
do
what
to
do
what
to
do
what
to
do...
Burning
his
thoughts
and
making
his
brain
glow
<@203488399061942272>
seeks
out
a
breakthrough.
However
even
if
the
brain
is
used
so
hard
that
the
synapse
will
be
burned
the
second
best
measure
will
not
come
out
immediately
after
the
light
that
grabbed
is
unraveled.
The
situation
is
getting
worse
and
the
number
of
people
you
can
rely
on
is
decreasing.
A
person
who
understands
the
circumstances
and
has
the
understanding
to
listen
to
<@203488399061942272>s
words.
A
person
who
swallows
a
lot
of
information
that
cannot
be
disclosed
and
still
has
a
conversation.
I
cant
find
anything
even
if
I
think
alone.
I
cant
rely
on
Echidna
anymore.
Then
<@203488399061942272>
could
only
find
another
person
to
share
the
issue
with.
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
I
never
thought
Id
come
to
visit
this
late
at
night.
...
Instead
I
think
its
a
well-prepared
way
of
waiting.
Instead
of
turning
off
the
lights
to
sleep
I
just
changed
the
fire.
Oh
its
tough.
Well
Im
not
wrong.
Roswar
with
his
pillow
on
his
back
and
his
upper
body
in
the
bed
relaxes
his
cheeks
to
welcome
<@203488399061942272>.
The
lights
in
Roswars
sleeping
area
were
originally
extinguished
but
the
flames
on
the
sconces
on
the
small
table
by
the
bed
had
just
been
replaced
and
the
orange
light
shimmered
and
shone
in
the
room.
A
mysteriously
shimmering
fire
color
with
a
pathologically
white
Roswars
face
eerily
shadowing.
Watching
this
<@203488399061942272>
was
holding
a
small
breath
and
trying
to
have
a
conversation.
If
<@203488399061942272>s
knowledge
is
true
the
conversation
with
Roswar
is--.
Well
did
you
bother
to
come
to
visit
me
at
night?
Hey
why
did
you
come
to
me
with
a
persuasive
phrase?
...Isnt
it
wrong
to
say
that
I
have
to
sneak
in?
I
wonder
if
there
is
a
way
to
get
out
of
the
sanctuary
without
a
trial
Roswar.
「――――」
With
just
one
word
<@203488399061942272>
feels
that
the
quality
of
Roswars
smile
is
chilling.
In
fact
the
smile
of
a
clown
has
a
higher
proportion
of
tearing
his
lips
sideways
and
Roswar
who
strokes
his
indigo
hair
nods
many
times
staring
at
<@203488399061942272>
with
his
yellow
eyes
<@203488399061942272>-kun.
How
many
times
have
you
been?
The
question
became
a
restraint
that
both
parties
knew
the
surface
of
the
others
information.
Roswar
gets
the
fact
that
<@203488399061942272>
is
returning
to
death
and
<@203488399061942272>
is
in
a
position
to
know
that
respectively.
<@203488399061942272>
must
then
revise
the
information
that
Roswar
has
and
make
concessions.
Exhale
briefly
and
<@203488399061942272>
shrugs
his
shoulders
with
a
dainty
gesture.
Its
bad
but
its
a
stupid
number
to
count.
I
cant
remember
how
many
times
youve
had
such
a
stomach
hunt.
Yeah...
I
dont
think
so.
Its
okay
for
you
to
talk
in
such
a
divided
way...
I
think
thats
what
I
mean
right?
Well
how
about
you?
<@203488399061942272>
has
a
posture
that
diverts
his
line
of
sight
and
imposes
the
point
of
conversation.
However
during
the
conversation
<@203488399061942272>
did
not
miss
Roswars
cheeks
bulging
in
these
words.
And
the
first
move
is
that
I
would
have
taken
the
initiative.
--Roswar
knows
the
fact
that
<@203488399061942272>
orbits
but
he
cannot
carry
over
the
memory
of
the
lap
like
<@203488399061942272>.
That
is
the
information
<@203488399061942272>
learned
in
the
loop
of
times
when
Roswar
discovered
that
he
knew
return
to
death.
After
understanding
his
own
death
and
end
he
also
learned
of
Roswars
incomprehensible
obsession
to
reach
the
desired
result
by
<@203488399061942272>s
Return
to
Death.
I
still
cant
help
but
feel
hatred
and
rejection
of
his
thinking.
We
are
still
in
the
process
of
trial
and
error.
I
would
like
you
to
cooperate.
The
dichotomy
which
can
be
said
to
be
disdainful
of
himself
reminded
<@203488399061942272>
to
act
in
the
illusion
that
he
was
acting
as
Roswar
had
intended.
There
is
no
doubt
that
Roswar
is
more
familiar
with
the
inside
of
the
sanctuary
than
<@203488399061942272>
at
this
stage.
Regarding
what
will
happen
in
the
future
it
is
difficult
to
get
together
because
it
is
unknown
how
much
the
Roswars
Gospel
has
written
but
remembering
his
murmuring
after
seeing
the
rabbit
it
seems
that
details
are
not
written
so
much
Im
guessing
there
is.
In
other
words
it
is
considered
possible
for
<@203488399061942272>
to
extract
information
while
deceiving
Roswar
without
making
a
mistake
in
selecting
words.
“A
part
of
that
trial
and
error
is
going
through
the
“sanctuary”
without
trying
the
“trial”...
I
wonder
if
that
is
a
bearish
thing.
If
you
have
the
power
you
have
unlimited
challenges.
Im
sure
I
can
overcome
the
difficulties
at
the
end.I
dont
know
how
much
I
challenged
but...
give
up
and
ask
for
another
method-Isnt
he
prepared?
I
dont
think
its
a
smart
way
to
stick
to
just
trying
to
get
over
the
trials
but
if
theres
a
smarter
way
to
choose
it
thats
it.
Its
all
about
the
form.
Its
ridiculous
to
overlook
it.
What
is
needed
is
that
Emilia
is
given
the
fact
and
credit
for
being
able
to
get
out
of
this
place...
is
it
Roswar?
While
keeping
calm
and
calm
on
the
surface
<@203488399061942272>
thinks
in
real
time
if
there
is
any
mistake
in
his
statement.
Scrutinizing
the
words
on
the
verge
of
putting
them
on
the
tongue
and
scrutinizing
the
work
to
spun
it
is
impossible
to
deceive
Roswar
without
shaving
the
mind
and
body.
Cruel
divisive-probably
Roswaals
desired
posture
for
<@203488399061942272>.
There
is
no
doubt
that
Roswar
wants
Emilia
to
become
king
and
that
<@203488399061942272>
will
help
him.
I
also
imagined
that
the
method
would
be
evaluated
as
desirable
as
the
more
subtle
way
<@203488399061942272>
would
be.
And
as
expected.
Ahh...
thats
certainly
my
favorite
answer.
To
<@203488399061942272>s
answer
Roswar
smiled
with
satisfaction.
<@203488399061942272>
barely
looks
at
the
white
face
with
the
clown
make-up
on
it
by
biting
the
inside
of
the
cheek
and
keeping
the
expression.
The
terrifying
eyes
of
Roswar
are
the
eyes
that
make
<@203488399061942272>
look
like
his
own.
In
other
words
it
was
judged
to
Rozwar
that
<@203488399061942272>
stood
on
the
same
stage
as
he
who
could
not
understand.
--Physical
disgust
comes
from
the
inside.
Im
still
aware
of
my
own
distortion
and
where
there
is
such
a
difference.
“Im
glad
I
see
Kimis
change
of
thinking
but
its
difficult
to
answer
the
question.
There
is
no
precedent.
After
all
the
barrier
has
not
been
broken
since
it
was
stretched.
Ive
never
thought
about
whether
or
not
and
I
think
we
should
throw
away
the
optimism
that
there
are
omissions
if
we
think
about
the
existence
that
stretched
out
in
the
first
place.
Is
it
the
barrier
of
Echidna?
And
so.
The
graveyard
of
the
sanctuary
is
a
gravestone
for
her
and
the
barrier
is
to
prevent
the
half
that
she
used
in
the
experiment
from
escaping
during
her
life....
Im
sure
youre
on
the
lookout
too.
Well
of
course.
I
know
of
course
Im
aware
of
the
facility
in
the
woods
Lew
Meyer.
Its
a
replica
and
the
Garfield
has
command.
Ah
the
story
isnt
too
fast.
<@203488399061942272>
also
carefully
considers
his
hand
to
Roswar
who
is
disclosing
information
one
after
another.
In
response
Roswar
closes
his
eyes
and
exhales
with
a
thoughtful
posture.
The
liberation
of
the
sanctuary
is
indispensable
for
Emilia
to
become
a
king.
If
you
break
the
paper
you
wont
be
able
to
convince
the
residents
of
the
sanctuary
and
the
villagers
of
Alam
Village.
If
you
can
get
out
of
the
world
theres
a
lot
of
tricks
you
can
fool
around
there.
This
isnt
the
only
chance
you
can
make
a
deal
before
that.
Youll
judge
that
the
time
was
bad
and
look
for
another
opportunity...
Another
opportunity?
Hmm
do
you
do
that
again?
Susubaru
realizes
that
he
is
apologetic
to
Roswar
who
makes
his
eyes
look
strange.
The
way
<@203488399061942272>
plays
today
is
to
be
able
to
redo
as
many
times
as
possible
and
to
be
determined
to
scrape
himself.
If
you
think
of
<@203488399061942272>s
slaughter
there
is
no
reason
not
to
make
it
a
thing
if
you
have
a
chance
to
collect
achievements
before
your
eyes.
In
order
not
to
express
regret
and
before
Roswars
suspicion
continues
<@203488399061942272>
utters
Think
about
it.
As
you
know
I
can
do
as
much
as
I
can
to
make
Emilia
king.
Thats
because
I
prepare
and
bring
back
all
the
information
of
the
future.
Its
a
small
event
with
few
people
involved
and
you
should
focus
your
attention
on
the
events
that
have
a
higher
impact
such
as
white
whales
and
witches.--This
is
not
a
stage
worth
putting
effort
into.
...Well
the
liberation
of
the
sanctuary
is
a
must.
Ill
make
it
an
indelible
line.
I
still
have
to
say
Im
skeptical
about
your
strength.
Skeptical...?
Robbal
nods
to
<@203488399061942272>
who
twists
his
head
in
a
different
flow
than
he
expected.
Wow
I
cant
see
your
right
to
redo
with
this
eye.
It
doesnt
mean
that
youre
not
in
your
mouth.
I
see.
The
result
is.
If
it
accompanies
it
Ill
be
convinced
though.
.........
I
affirm
my
power
is
indispensable
for
Emilia
to
become
a
king...
The
cooperation
of
the
Mathers
family
is
indispensable.
By
releasing
the
sanctuary
your
power
to
help
Emilia
is
By
making
me
believe
that
it
is
a
certain
thing
it
will
lead
to
a
good
relationship
in
the
future...I
want
you
to
think
so.
<@203488399061942272>
doesnt
make
a
whistling
noise
in
Roswars
squinting
theory.
All
Roswars
arguments
are
true
and
effective
counterarguments
do
not
come
to
<@203488399061942272>.
In
order
to
carry
the
candidate
for
King
Emilia
on
the
stage
of
the
election
a
backing
is
indispensable
and
other
than
Roswar
there
are
no
influential
people
who
can
do
it.
The
fact
that
<@203488399061942272>
is
currently
trying
to
do
anything
about
it
is
nothing
more
than
surpassing
the
current
situation
and
it
does
not
continue.
Its
the
right
way
to
follow
the
instructions
so
that
you
dont
hurt
your
patrons.
It
is
too
correct
given
the
legitimacy
of
Roswars
opinion
and
the
urgency
of
the
situation.
However
<@203488399061942272>
felt
uncomfortable
despite
the
reasoning.
It
seemed
that
Roswar
was
too
concerned
about
the
liberation
of
the
sanctuary.
I
think
the
story
will
change
a
little...
Yeah
what?
With
one
finger
up
Roswar
hangs
on
<@203488399061942272>s
attention.
<@203488399061942272>
said
looking
at
his
eyes
with
different
colors.
Is
there
a
reason
you
want
to
free
the
sanctuary?
「――――」
When
asked
Roswar
is
just
silent.
With
a
silent
smile
he
slowly
smiles
and
a
yellow
gaze
penetrates
<@203488399061942272>.
――
Again
<@203488399061942272>
felt
the
changing
air
in
his
skin.
Feeling
Roswars
pressure
to
pierce
his
skin
<@203488399061942272>
understood
that
his
current
statement
touched
the
heart
of
Roswars
speculation.
Roswars
smile
is
as
good
as
when
he
half-confided
his
thoughts
on
the
verge
of
being
haunted
by
rabbits
in
the
snow.
The
expression
which
is
different
from
ideology
and
delight
was
enough
to
make
<@203488399061942272>
wary.
Why
do
you
think
so?
<@203488399061942272>
flutters
at
Roswars
masquerade
which
he
has
no
intention
of
advancing
smoothly
during
this
period.
After
that
I
prefaced
By
all
means
Because
I
didnt
think
the
way
I
suggested
it
was
to
be
honest.
It
would
be
natural
for
me
to
think
there
would
be
something
if
all
the
conditions
on
my
head
were
to
release
the
sanctuary.
Im
going
to
give
a
coherent
explanation
about
that.
Well
in
the
first
place
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
proof
in
order
to
cooperate
with
each
other
in
the
first
place.
The
basis
for
continuing
to
lend
power
to
Emilia-that
is
You
have
to
be
near
Emilia
to
find
the
optimal
solution
and
I
want
you
to
believe
it.
The
condition
for
that
is
the
liberation
of
the
sanctuary.
I
dont
mind
liberation
but
I
think
there
are
any
ways
to
get
out
of
here.
I
can
prepare
as
many
chances
as
I
have
a
chance
to
prove...
On
the
contrary
I
want
to
hear
it.
Roswar
points
out
one
finger
as
he
argues
against
<@203488399061942272>s
bite.
When
<@203488399061942272>
paused
for
silence
Roswar
nodded
Youre
crazy
about
trials
and
hips.
It
seems
like
theres
a
reason
you
dont
want
to
release
the
sanctuary?
Why
dont
you
want
to
release
it?
Open
the
barrier
and
pull
out
the
problems
that
cannot
be
solved
in
the
middle...
but?
Suddenly
speaking
<@203488399061942272>
realizes
that
he
is
about
to
get
on
Roswars
story.
If
you
speak
rough
words
here
and
talk
without
thinking
the
tricks
will
be
given
to
Roswar.
Make
an
effort
and
stay
calm
choose
your
words.
I
want
to
challenge
that
trial
and
see
Emilia
be
hurt.
Thats
why
its
your
power?
If
Emilia
stumbled
upon
a
trial
you
could
do
it.
No
problem.
What
matters
is
the
fact
that
you
were
released
as
you
said.
Nu-gu...
As
he
was
curled
up
with
what
he
said
<@203488399061942272>
bites
his
lips
and
looks
for
the
continuation
of
the
words.
However
the
assertion
of
over-exerting
is
difficult
to
make
sense.
I
know
that
its
me
or
Emilia
who
breaks
through
the
trial.
Its
too
tight
for
Emilia
to
be
scratched
in
the
past.
Even
if
I
should
replace...
No
way
its
hard
for
you
to
try
so
youre
not
saying
that
youre
trying
to
find
a
way
out?
Roswars
line
of
sight
becomes
tighter
and
the
sharpness
of
his
pursuit
increases.
Roswar
continued
to
mutter
<@203488399061942272>
saying
No
way
Im
so
cute
Im
painful...
If
thats
the
reason
why
youre
looking
for
another
way
your
thoughts
on
Emilia
are
that
much
right?
That
is...!
No?
Really?
Why
can
you
say
that?
Who
can
you
believe?
When
you
think
of
Emilia
whether
its
painful
painful
or
painful
its
natural
to
swallow
everything?
If
you
love
Emilia
Well
if
you
can
do
that
its
natural
that
if
Emilia
is
more
important
than
anything
else
you
can
divide
it
with
a
trivial
presence
to
push
Emilia
higher
than
anything
else
emphasizing
Emilia
over
everything
else...
There
should
be
no
problem?
As
if
to
say
he
is
swallowed
by
the
atmosphere
of
Roswar
which
arranges
his
words
fluently.
Rozwars
words
such
as
the
extreme
theory
itself
but
if
you
understand
<@203488399061942272>s
return
to
death
it
is
one
of
the
natural
conclusions.
Or
if
it
was
<@203488399061942272>
before
Satella
uncovered
her
true
feelings
at
the
Witchs
Tea
Party
we
may
have
finally
agreed.
--Oh
thats
right.
<@203488399061942272>
intended
to
declare
to
Roswar
who
said
he
wouldnt
look
like
Roswar
and
cut
off
all
but
one
important
thing.
However
if
Echidna
took
the
hand
at
the
tea
party
that
followed
<@203488399061942272>
would
surely
be
in
the
way
Roswar
wanted.
Abandon
your
thoughts
squeeze
your
choices
seek
results
only
despise
everything.
No
matter
how
much
I
hurt
myself
I
thought
that
the
future
I
hoped
for
would
be
that
of
Emilia
and
everyones
smiles.
But
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>
who
just
chose
to
endure
such
a
dilemma
would
be
laughing
the
same
next
to
them
at
the
last
moment?
――If
you
have
to
laugh
you
may
have
a
dry
smile
because
you
are
rushed
to
your
sense
of
duty.
...What
you
say
is
correct
in
a
sense
Roswar
What
do
you
mean?
Roswar
tilts
his
head
in
response
to
<@203488399061942272>s
meaningful
response
with
one
eye
closed.
Gaze
at
that
yellow
gaze
and
let
<@203488399061942272>
spit
out
As
you
say
if
you
can
throw
away
everything
and
keep
running
to
protect
only
Emilia...
Im
sure
only
Emilia
can
save.
But
thats
not
enough.
insufficient……
I
save
Emilia.
But
Emilia
isnt
happy
alone.
Rem
Beatrice
the
sanctuary
and
the
mansion
the
many
who
were
taken
care
of
in
the
royal
capital...
all
together.
I
want
to
save
you.
「――――」
I
cant
live
your
life
alone
I
honestly
dont
know
if
Im
the
greedy
or
you.
The
attitude
of
thinking
about
one
person
and
throwing
everything
away
just
for
that
is
kind
of
beautiful.
Living
in
love
is
a
precious
act
that
is
nothing
else
than
that.
Roswars
method
may
be
one
completed
as
a
mans
way
of
life.
However
in
order
to
imitate
it
it
requires
a
fierce
determination
and
it
is
unlikely
that
<@203488399061942272>
will
be
able
to
live
off
the
important
things
like
cutting
the
soul.
As
usual
his
vessel
was
tiny-<@203488399061942272>
remained
a
selfish
child.
...Duh
youre
not
prepared
to
sharpen
yourself
yet.
.........
A
little...
yes
I
expected
a
little.
Maybe
I
could
see
what
I
wanted
but...
I
dont
think
so.
Its
a
pity
Roswar
shakes
his
head
while
saying
that.
In
the
current
exchange
it
was
revealed
to
Rozwar
that
<@203488399061942272>
was
not
able
to
determine
his
intention.
<@203488399061942272>
is
a
disappointing
defect
for
Roswar
who
wants
<@203488399061942272>
to
take
on
the
challenge
with
a
ruthless
determination.
At
the
same
time
its
all
about
seeing
the
end
of
your
life.
How
many
more
times...
will
I
be
discouraged
by
you?
If
you
think
so
Id
love
to
be
more
supportive
to
you.
You
just
help
me
out
and
most
problems
will
be
resolved.
<@203488399061942272>
tells
Roswar
who
does
not
hide
his
disappointment
to
say
ironically.
In
fact
for
<@203488399061942272>
who
is
totally
naive
in
terms
of
strength
Roswar
wants
his
power
to
come
out
of
his
throat.
Roswars
cooperation
is
indispensable
for
the
threat
of
the
Great
Rabbit
a
technique
that
accurately
slaughters
the
Great
Rabbit
that
has
flared
in
the
Devil
Beast
Forest
and
the
attacking
Great
Rabbit.
To
put
it
the
other
way
around
half
the
problems
on
the
sanctuary
side
can
be
cleared
if
you
can
pull
Roswar
into
your
allies.
However
Roswar
shook
his
head
on
<@203488399061942272>s
easy-going
but
certain
demands
Unfortunately
not
because
cooperating
with
you
in
the
present
situation
is
too
little
for
me.
I
suppose-yes
maybe
you
could
get
through
this
phase
with
my
help.
With
the
vagueness
of
your
preparedness
you
and
Emilia
who
have
advanced
further
will
always
hit
a
wall
somewhere..
When
that
happens
will
you
rely
on
me
again?
What
if
I
fall
into
an
irreversible
situation
and
go
right
and
left?”
.........
<@203488399061942272>-kun
I...
I
cant
decide
to
lend
power
to
someone
I
can
trust
for
my
purpose.
I
dont
need
a
relationship
that
is
leaning
on
my
purpose.
So
you
I
want
them
to
convince
me
and
be
prepared
to
move
forward.
Your
purpose...
Its
a
pity
that
it
didnt
happen
this
time.
Lets
look
forward
to
the
next
opportunity.
When
you
truly
accept
your
power
right.
The
story
is
over
Roswar
relaxes
and
lays
himself
in
bed.
For
Roswar
the
meaning
of
living
now
is
lost.
With
a
mind
like
a
digestive
match
he
may
see
the
failed
<@203488399061942272>
start
over
and
finish.
If
the
conversation
ends
like
this
<@203488399061942272>
will
not
be
able
to
fulfill
any
purpose
here.
<@203488399061942272>
desperately
turns
his
head
watching
Roswars
gesture
that
prompts
him
to
leave
the
room
if
he
cannot
withdraw
all
the
time
...What
is
my
determination
to
show
you?
Hmmm...I
really
want
to
know
what
I
mean
by
getting
in
touch
with
me
but
its
a
waste
of
time
to
redo
just
that.
Roswar
responded
to
the
words
of
<@203488399061942272>
connected
and
when
he
raised
his
body
again
he
put
his
hand
on
his
chin
The
general
rule
of
thumb
is
the
liberation
of
the
sanctuary.
However
your
actions
are
essential
to
the
liberation
of
the
sanctuary
and
you
need
to
be
prepared
to
do
it
again
and
again.
Liberation
of
the
sanctuary
is
a
proof
of
the
consequences
of
your
determination.
Why
is
that?
It
may
be
that
the
answer
is
the
closest
but
thats
not
it...
If
I
just
get
over
the
trials
Im
prepared
to
throw
away
everything.
Theres
no
possibility
that
Emilia
could
go
beyond
her
trial...
It
cant
be
Roswars
remark
seems
to
be
too
extreme
and
<@203488399061942272>
argues
immediately.
But
his
answer
was
straightforward
and
cold.
Roswar
waved
his
raised
finger
to
<@203488399061942272>
who
was
confused
by
his
sharpness
Your
fleeting
expectations
will
never
come
to
fruition.
Emilia-sama
cant
get
past
the
trial.
It
cant
happen.
Its
not
strong
enough
to
do
that.
...That?
Yeah.
It
may
be
influenced
by
the
environment
in
which
I
grew
up
and
my
customs
but
I
cant
do
that.
Its
a
weak
fragile
little
child
who
cant
stand
alone.
He
rushes
to
guilt
and
remorse.
I
am
even
merciful
because
I
am
too
cheerful
such
as
being
moved
and
moving.
<@203488399061942272>
is
exaggerated
by
Roswar
who
gives
Emilias
reputation
that
he
has
never
heard
before.
Emilia
who
is
lovable
hard-working
friendly
and
hard-working.
<@203488399061942272>
is
now
out
of
contact
and
cannot
give
answers
to
the
trials
but
<@203488399061942272>
believes
that
she
has
the
power
to
overcome
the
past
and
lead
to
the
liberation
of
the
sanctuary
if
time
is
spent.
ing.
However
<@203488399061942272>
still
wanted
to
take
the
trial
instead
of
Emilia
because
he
could
not
secure
the
necessary
time
and
could
not
see
Emilia
being
hurt.
This
is
not
because
Emilia
is
giving
up
and
seeing
that
she
cannot
break
through
the
“trial”.
But
you
cant
do
Emilia...
then
why
then!
Because
you
are.
If
you
exist
you
can
aim
for
the
throne
even
if
you
are
a
weak
half-elf
with
no
power.
No
I
will
put
it
on
the
throne.
Of
course.
You
fulfill
her
wishes
you
have
that
power.
If
Emilia-sama
is
worth
it
you
have
the
strongest
card
you.
I...
the
strongest
card...?
<@203488399061942272>
is
embarrassed
when
he
throws
up
Roswars
seemingly
convoluted
words
and
a
picture-like
word
saying
that
he
is
the
strongest.
Its
an
adjective
far
from
being
helpless.
And
Roswars
words
are
too
insulting
for
the
existence
of
Emilia
and
unforgivable.
Dont
play
around!
Emilia...
I
think
Emilias
trying
hard
thinking
a
lot
and
trying
the
trials
with
painful
feelings!
I
dig
up
the
past
that
I
dont
want
to
see
and
that
The
child...
desperately
trying
hard!
You
do
it!
Everything
is
useless
if
there
are
no
results.
And
I
think
you
know
better
than
I
did
that
no
results.
Emilias
hard
work
If
there
was
a
result
of
there
is
no
reason
for
you
to
come
back
here.
-------!
Even
if
the
voice
is
furious
and
violent
it
doesnt
work
for
Roswar
who
does
not
spoil
calmness.
On
the
contrary
<@203488399061942272>s
words
are
shut
down
so
that
his
hot
thoughts
can
be
bathed
in
cold
water.
In
fact
Roswars
case
is
part
of
reality.
As
far
as
<@203488399061942272>
has
seen
Emilia
has
never
been
able
to
overcome
the
trial-even
the
first
trial.
She
keeps
trying
hard
but
the
walls
of
the
past
stand
in
front
of
the
attempt
each
time
crushing
and
abrading
her
heart.
Unable
to
lean
on
a
puck
that
he
can
trust
he
wears
up
and
Emilia
who
misunderstands
<@203488399061942272>s
dependence
on
love
breaks.
Knowing
its
future
<@203488399061942272>
can
only
make
emotional
objections
to
Roswars
words.
However
there
is
no
way
to
silently
overlook
the
words
that
insult
Emilia.
Roswar
looks
down
on
Emilia
and
puts
too
much
hope
on
<@203488399061942272>s
Return
to
Death.
How
can
I
break
the
nose
bridge?-<@203488399061942272>
was
screaming
at
the
moment
he
came
up
with
it.
I
understand
what
you
mean!
But
I
havent
done
your
prospect!
What
do
you
mean...
You
want
me
to
break
the
trial
instead
of
Emilia...
Echidna
deprived
me
of
the
trial
qualification!
You
cant
pull
your
expected
results
from
me
anymore.
It
was
disappointing-!
<@203488399061942272>
with
his
chest
on
his
hand
appeals
to
Roswar
who
has
a
generous
face
with
a
high
appeal.
It
was
a
painful
event
for
<@203488399061942272>
but
it
should
have
been
a
huge
blow
to
Roswars
prospects.
It
was
when
<@203488399061942272>
tried
to
make
a
grinning
smile
saying
that
even
Roswar
couldnt
be
in
a
normal
state.
--Did
you
be
disqualified?
The
spilling
and
spilling
sound
was
so
unreliable
that
<@203488399061942272>
was
too
late
to
realize
that
it
was
from
Roswar
in
front
of
him.
In
front
of
her
Roswar
who
puts
herself
in
the
bed
hardens
to
<@203488399061942272>s
words.
Then
he
pushed
his
twines
of
different
colors
to
open
and
shook
his
lips
a
little
while
seeing
<@203488399061942272>.
There
is
a
usual
attitude
a
sensible
atmosphere
that
looks
at
everything
a
dash
of
astute
awesomeness-all
as
if
they
had
come
off.
What
do
you
mean...
No
matter
what...
just
as
it
is.
Called
with
a
blurred
voice
<@203488399061942272>
inadvertently
rubs
his
voice
up.
While
being
pressured
by
a
voice
like
a
different
person
from
Roswar
that
I
knew
<@203488399061942272>
moistened
with
a
saliva
that
swallowed
his
throat
that
complained
of
thirst
Echidna
picked
up
my
qualifications.
Instead
of
commanding
a
replica
Im
now
trying
to
go
into
the
grave
and
my
eyes
are
down.
The
positions
are
together.
Nah...
no
why
did
you
do
that.
You
got
a
trial
in
the
grave...
otherwise
the
liberation
of
this
sanctuary
was
her
true
life...
Roswar
with
his
hand
on
his
mouth
murmurs
with
an
incredible
look.
<@203488399061942272>
suddenly
loses
sight
of
the
words
realizing
that
the
effect
was
more
than
he
had
intended.
Rozwars
dismay
its
the
first
time
Ive
met
him
let
alone
the
laps
and
I
dont
know
where
the
current
exchange
was
that
shocked
him.
However
<@203488399061942272>
took
a
breath
Did
you
say
that
you
would
break
through
the
trials
in
your
Gospel?
「――――」
I
know
that
you
have
to
be
willing
to
throw
everything
away
unless
you
follow
the
description.
So
if
you
were
to
break
through
the
Sanctuary
it
was
my
role...
It
wont
come
true
anymore.
The
witch
castle
of
greed
was
out
of
the
control
of
this
world
as
if
the
witches
had
overtaken
the
return
to
death
and
shared
their
memories
as
if
they
had
taken
over
the
first
trial
breakthrough.
..
Even
if
I
did
return
to
death
the
memories
and
thoughts
I
had
at
that
castle
did
not
fade.
Thats
why
<@203488399061942272>
felt
helped
at
that
place
and
had
a
great
deal
of
hope
and
hope
for
Echidna.
――So
I
understand
now.
Now
even
if
he
died
and
returned
to
the
grave
his
qualifications
would
not
return
to
<@203488399061942272>.
Echidnas
permission
is
required
to
regain
it
and
to
get
Echidnas
permission
you
must
enter
the
graveyard
and
you
must
be
qualified
to
enter
the
graveyard.
--That
is
the
way
<@203488399061942272>
challenges
the
trial
of
the
grave
is
now
completely
lost.
How
to
get
your
qualification
back...
If
there
is
you
know
better
than
me.
If
you
say
you
dont
know
I
dont.
Responding
to
Roswars
shrill
voice
<@203488399061942272>
internally
realizes
the
possibilities.
Perhaps
Echidna
still
sees
<@203488399061942272>s
scratching
and
suffering
in
the
grave.
It
would
be
harassment
of
<@203488399061942272>
who
rejected
the
hand
disqualification
in
such
a
way
and
would
like
to
see
what
<@203488399061942272>
who
took
the
hand
of
Satella
can
do.
In
the
process
<@203488399061942272>
will
continue
to
make
mistakes
and
if
Echidna
cries
and
plucks
when
there
is
no
other
way
to
strike
then
the
witch
will
probably
reach
out
to
<@203488399061942272>.
――But
if
you
take
Echidnas
hand
to
you
next
time
it
will
throw
away
all
the
words
you
tell
Satela
and
the
thoughts
you
have
at
this
moment.
Deliver
Emilia
to
the
best
future
with
the
end
that
ends.
Even
so
it
may
be
a
little
better
than
the
ending
that
breaks
down
on
the
way.
Will
you
try
again
and
return
before
being
disqualified...?
It
seems
like
Im
misunderstanding
but
its
not
such
an
all-purpose
power.
I
cant
handle
it
so
comfortably
that
I
can
return
to
it
at
no
cost...
in
the
first
place
it
is
too
late
to
return.
That
doesnt
change.
Really……
Roswars
voice
in
response
to
<@203488399061942272>s
reply
was
weak
and
it
seemed
to
<@203488399061942272>
as
if
he
had
grown
old
all
at
once.
Up
until
now
Roswaal
has
always
been
wielding
an
unknown
age-less
rather
than
youthfulness
but
even
now
his
mood
with
his
small
shoulders
disappears.
There
is
a
human-like
face
that
suffers
from
long-time
and
long-time
delusional
feelings
that
are
blocked
in
the
places
where
they
cannot
reach.
For
the
first
time
<@203488399061942272>
could
feel
that
Roswar
was
like
the
same
person
because
of
the
appearance
that
even
clown
makeup
could
not
hide.
But
if
that
didnt
help
it
would
have
been
a
reluctance
for
Roswar.
Im
stuck
with
the
same
thing
Roswar.
I
think
you
and
I
should
talk
more
and
find
a
way
out.
「――――」
It
may
be
tough
for
you
to
pull
out
the
results
according
to
that
Gospel
but
the
description
should
not
end
there.
If
only
the
outline
is
followed...
It
may
not
be
convincing
but
if
there
is
a
compromise...
...Wasnt
it?
--Ah?
<@203488399061942272>
uses
a
word
to
create
an
eclectic
plan
and
somehow
make
a
concession
from
Roswar.
However
Roswar
murmured
something
small
with
an
empty
eye
as
if
he
could
not
hear
<@203488399061942272>s
words.
Unconsciously
open
his
mouth
<@203488399061942272>
takes
a
step
forward.
I
wonder
if
it
wasnt
wrong
now
what
Roswar
said.
Then
Roswars
murmuring
sneaks
into
the
ear
of
<@203488399061942272>.
that
is
I
mean
I
didnt
get
enough.
what?
I
dont
know
how
it
happened
but
Echidna
changed
the
decision
and
there
must
have
been
a
corresponding
exchange
with
you.
Normally
before
such
a
crack
between
you
and
her
Youre
ready
to
go
into
the
trials...yes
I
couldnt.
「――――」
If
Im
pushing
you
more
Ill
show
you
that
Im
reaching
out
and
Im
going
to
drop
whats
important
to
me...
Wait
Roswar.
Wait
Feeling
that
he
was
trying
to
say
something
definitive
what
he
was
trying
to
say
<@203488399061942272>
hesitated
but
for
some
reason
to
hear
what
had
to
be
heard.
After
hearing
the
words
that
follow
<@203488399061942272>
will
no
longer
be
able
to
stand
here.
I
was
confident.
No
in
the
first
place
there
was
a
part
that
I
doubted
that
was
the
case.
But
even
so
I
didnt
put
the
suspects
in
the
back
because
I
had
stopped
thinking
if
I
had
no
reason
to
do
it
and
because
I
had
a
thin
trust
in
Roswar.
Thats
a
crucial
break
in
what
he
says
now.
Before
that
happens
I
have
to
say
something.
However
that
word
can
not
be
found
anywhere
in
<@203488399061942272>
time
passes
constantly
I
also
called
you
and
Emilia
to
the
sanctuary
after
knowing
the
nature
of
Garfeel.
「――――」
“Knowing
the
horror
of
the
“Trial”
we
asked
Emilia
to
challenge
her
and
show
her
a
hurt
figure
to
encourage
her.”
Wait
wait.
Ma--
And
Youll
be
able
to
complete
it
by
losing
important
things
out
of
reach...
everything
wasnt
enough
yet.
--Roswar
confessed
that
he
had
triggered
the
mansions
tragedy.
Unraveling
unraveling
falling
down
from
below.
Losing
sight
of
the
scaffolding
he
was
sure
to
have
<@203488399061942272>
felt
as
if
he
had
fallen
from
a
high
place.
The
actual
<@203488399061942272>
stands
in
the
middle
of
the
room
wide
open
and
rigid.
Despite
this
I
had
such
an
illusion
because
the
impact
of
Roswars
confession
was
so
great
for
<@203488399061942272>.
I
cant
reach
my
hands...
I
think
you
already
have
the
answer.
If
something
important
and
something
important
at
the
same
time
are
put
into
crisis
people
are
forced
to
make
a
choice.
Those
who
choose
which
is
more
important
and
who
are
not
chosen
The
chosen
way
of
life
is
that
you
are
the
only
one
who
is
able
to
remove
all
but
one
important
thing
and
complete
it.”
Its
ridiculous!
Completed
existence!?
To
me
I
can
only
see
an
insanely
stupid
stupid
man
standing
alone
in
the
windswept
wilderness!
But
an
important
being
can
be
held
in
a
place
full
of
greenery
while
maintaining
its
innocent
beauty.
Is
that
a
priority
over
your
own
injury?
<@203488399061942272>
confuses
Roswars
question
which
is
recovering
some
calmness.
It
wasnt
overstated
or
lost
sight
of
the
rebuttal
words.
However
the
amount
of
emotions
that
erupted
was
so
great
that
I
could
not
even
say
it
in
words.
――I
have
never
felt
the
phrase
that
I
could
not
say
anything
because
I
was
amazed.
Is
it
the
tragedy
of
that
mansion
that
the
result
of
abandoning
thoughts
and
obeying
the
Gospels
which
line
up
selfish
events
with
such
unknown
theories?
Frederica
Petra
and
even
Beatrice
die
for
such
selfishness.
Maybe
they
would
betrayed
by
the
Lord
who
should
have
been
trusted
for
the
sole
purpose
of
completing
<@203488399061942272>
and
would
die.
Roswar...
are
you
really
doing
something...?
...Yeah
Im
crazy
at
all.
Ive
been
messing
around
400
years
ago
ever
since
I
was
fascinated
by
that
eye.
Four
hundreds...?
The
meaning
of
the
thrown
word
cannot
be
swallowed
and
<@203488399061942272>
returns
the
parrot
and
frowns
in
confusion.
Once
again
400
years
ago-but
its
too
unnatural
for
Roswar
to
say
it.
There
should
be
no
way
for
him
to
know
400
years
ago.
Even
more
the
present
narrative
seems
to
have
existed
for
400
years
ago.
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>-kun
Suddenly
a
voice
called
up
to
<@203488399061942272>
who
confused
his
eyes.
If
you
look
at
it
there
is
Roswar
standing
up
in
front
of
you.
Standing
tall
at
a
breathtaking
distance
<@203488399061942272>
moves
his
mouth
like
gasping
and
puts
his
legs
backwards-grabbing
his
collar
and
unable
to
descend.
They
are
drawn
and
hit
their
forehead.
You
said
Im
doing
something
wrong.
I
agree
Im
sure
Im
doing
something
wrong.
Im
not
sane.
Ive
been
taken
away
by
heart
long
ago.
Oh
yeah...
Why
arent
you
doing
something
wrong
right?
Like
me
you
should
be
doing
something
better
than
me.
No
way
youre
in
a
position
where
you
cant
challenge.
Because
what
you
ask
for
is
much
higher
and
farther
than
what
I
ask
for
no
one
understands
it
you
cant
you
dont
need
a
human
heart
to
go
the
path
of
loneliness.
You
have
to
do
it
like
steel-is
it?
Oh
uh...
oooooo!
Roswars
voice
had
the
power
to
be
dragged
into
the
bottom
of
the
darkness
as
each
of
the
words
squeezed
into
his
mind.
<@203488399061942272>
shakes
his
head
as
if
to
shake
it
off
and
pierces
Roswars
chest
at
a
touching
distance.
With
a
finger
on
the
tall
body
that
steps
on
the
tatara
<@203488399061942272>
cant
hide
his
trembling
voice
No
matter
what
no
matter
what
your
prospects
smashed
when
my
qualifications
were
picked
up!
Any
speculation
in
the
mansion
was
a
useless
act
and
a
pointless
sacrifice!
Stop
the
stupid
imitation
right
away!
I
refuse.--I
saw
your
lack
of
preparedness
and
understood
the
need
more
and
more.
You
dont
need
to
be
human.
Lets
hunt
down
hurt
make
you
depend
on
Emilia
and
let
Emily
also
drown
you
in
love
which
is
only
a
dependency
if
you
are
an
indispensable
person.
Ill
take
the
path.
Its
the
only
way
my
purpose
can
be
achieved.
Well
what
does
that
mean...!
I
cant
get
rid
of
the
qualifications
Ive
lost
even
when
Ive
scraped
it!
I
cant
get
anything
because
of
my
broken
bones!
You
must
know
best
if
it
is
the
real
intention.
Roswars
voice
freezes
the
screaming
<@203488399061942272>.
My
heart
bounced
strongly
because
<@203488399061942272>
knew
the
true
meaning
of
Roswars
words.
Nothing
its
a
simple
story.
As
I
thought
earlier-Echidna
reaches
out
when
<@203488399061942272>
seriously
reconsiders
and
seeks
help.
If
you
really
get
really
stuck
<@203488399061942272>
has
the
way
to
go
if
you
just
have
to
move
forward.
And
that
is
If
you
are
back
Echidna
will
gladly
reissue
any
qualifications.
Its
no
wonder
of
her
nature
and
I
know
that
much.
.........
Dont
be
confused
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>.
You
are
not
the
only
person
who
understands
Echidna.
It
didnt
look
like
Roswar
it
was
a
voice
full
of
hatred
and
grudge.
<@203488399061942272>
hardens
herself
due
to
the
strength
of
the
bad
emotions
that
hit
her
so
straight.
Then
I
felt
the
purpose
of
Roswar
only
after
masticating
the
meaning.
You
give
priority
to
the
liberation
of
the
sanctuary...because
of
Echidnas
wishes.
.........
Can
you
clear
the
trial
of
his
graveyard
and
release
the
sanctuary...Is
that
how
you
think
it
will
be
connected
to
some
kind
of
memorial
service?
...In
life
Echidna
was
worried
about
what
the
end
would
be
like
after
her
death.
It
left
a
gimmick
in
the
grave
and
souls.
Just
the
end
she
wanted.
Hasnt
been
to
this
place
for
400
years.
The
barrier
surrounding
the
sanctuary
has
been
stretched
for
400
years
and
during
that
time
the
barrier
has
never
been
broken.
The
end
that
Echidna
wanted
and
wanted
to
see
has
not
yet
come.
Does
Roswar
want
to
show
the
end
to
Echidna
and
requisition
his
soul?
The
idea
itself
is
not
understandable.
In
the
original
world
he
never
believed
in
the
existence
of
souls
but
<@203488399061942272>
came
into
contact
with
Echidna
and
other
witches
in
this
world.
If
I
have
a
feeling
that
I
felt
in
contact
with
them
and
if
their
unskilledness
remains
here
I
have
a
feeling
of
gratefulness
as
much
as
I
would
like
to
make
it
come
true.
However
for
that
reason
it
is
outrageous
to
live
in
the
present
and
despise
other
important
people.
And
its
a
different
story.
Roswar
Echidnas
requiem
will
offer
another
opportunity.
I
can
promise
to
work
hard
for
that.
So
now
lets
pull
out
of
the
mansion.
I
refuse.
I
fulfill
my
wishes
Echidnas
wishes.
I
will
do
what
I
need.
I
will
plunge
others
as
much
as
I
need
hurt
you
and
suffer
mud.
Dont
be
involved
in
others
with
self-satisfaction!
If
you
can
pull
him
out
and
have
something
to
say
do
it
yourself!
You
cant
believe
the
guy
who
tried
to
create
the
future
the
child
who
still
has
the
future
the
future
Im
not
trying
to
sacrifice
a
locked-up
girl!
Neither
Frederica
Petra
nor
Beatrice
need
to
sacrifice
such
a
plan.
There
should
be
no
reason
to
be
associated
with
Roswahls
selfishness
let
alone
to
hurt
<@203488399061942272>
because
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
their
humanity.
“I
refuse.
The
only
thing
I
would
ask
is
to
sayjust
as
Roswar
says.
Everything
else
is
cut
off.
Their
sacrifice
is
inevitable.”
Dont
be
silly.
You
can
expose
what
you
plan
and
what
happens
as
a
result.
Before
you
act
think
what
you
mean.
What
does
that
mean?
When
you
publicize
my
evil
deeds
the
situation
surrounding
the
sanctuary
remains
the
same.
Emilia
is
the
King
Losing
the
backing
to
challenge
the
election
the
relationship
with
the
refugees
and
the
residents
of
the
sanctuary
will
surely
worsen.
How
many
times
have
you
seen
Emilia-sama
falling
with
your
eyes?
Ga
Garfeel
Frederica...
When
you
hear
that
your
sister
is
a
victim
of
your
plan
its
absolutely
free...
If
youre
counting
on
that
your
eyes
are
getting
cloudy.
Youll
never
let
Garfir
out
of
the
sanctuary
to
help
Frederica.
If
something
happens
to
the
sanctuary
in
the
meantime
there
is
a
pitiful
and
stupid
Garfir
who
can
not
move
because
of
being
caught
by
an
unprecedented
threat.
As
the
mind
goes
around
the
risk
can
be
thought
about
what
happens
to
the
sanctuary
when
I
lose
it
so
that
I
cant
move
to
your
advantage.
Its
a
child
desperately
trying
to
protect
a
weak
and
fragile
world.
The
expression
of
a
desperate
child
is
astounding.
Its
the
same
rating
that
the
witches
gave
to
<@203488399061942272>
at
the
tea
party
who
tried
to
sacrifice
me.
And
Roswar
seems
to
have
that
appearance
of
Garfield.
Not
knowing
what
it
seems
to
be
or
even
knowing
does
Garfir
continue
to
struggle
with
his
rooted
purpose?
Garfeel
doesnt
work
with
you.
Im
not
going
to
give
up.
You
just
need
to
wear
out
the
situation
that
doesnt
reach
you
be
honed
and
perfected.
No
more
needed.
Divide
it.
Yo
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>.-If
anyone
other
than
Emilia
is
dead
and
theres
nothing
to
do
with
it
please
divide
yourself.
Dont
play
around!
Im
not
like
you!
Im
not
like
you
Im
not
like
you...
Its
not
human
thinking!
.........
Im
a
human.
No
matter
what
kind
of
unfamiliar
power
is
given
no
matter
how
painful
or
painful
I
feel
it
will
not
be
harmed.-I
am
a
human.
Affirming
to
silent
Roswar
<@203488399061942272>
moves
backwards
and
distances
himself
from
his
tall
body.
Roswaal
had
a
neat
look
and
had
mixed
emotions
for
a
moment
then
shrugged.
Well
it
doesnt
matter.
As
long
as
you
have
unlimited
opportunities
its
the
same
for
me.
Lets
give
up
your
persuasion
this
time.
Ill
leave
it
to
me
next
time.
Even
if
this
isnt...
next
time
even
if
theres
another
next
Ill
never
nod
your
suggestion.
You
wont.
--Before
you
leave
the
room.
I
have
no
meaning
to
live
this
life
anymore.
Returning
to
the
bed
Roswar
who
wears
a
futon
leaves
that
much
to
say
and
removes
himself
from
<@203488399061942272>.
As
she
closed
her
eyes
and
tried
to
sleep
she
refused
to
communicate
with
<@203488399061942272>.
Opening
his
mouth
to
Roswars
attitude
but
no
words
came
out
「――――」
<@203488399061942272>
left
the
room
with
a
sense
of
defeat
while
keeping
quiet.
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
Leaving
Roswars
bed
<@203488399061942272>
is
walking
in
the
dim
light
of
the
moon.
--what
should
I
do
The
question
comes
from
the
question
of
the
invisible
problem
the
exact
same
sentence
repeated
in
the
chest
and
the
answer
does
not
just
come
back
like
a
tree
spirit.
The
question
that
is
thrown
away
does
not
reach
anyone
it
disappears
into
the
void
and
leaves
only
emptyness
in
the
throat
like
a
lump.
Literally
it
can
only
be
said
to
be
a
blockade.
Neither
Roswars
nor
Echidnas
cooperation
is
likely
to
be
gained
anymore.
Echidnas
cooperation
is
physically
impossible
and
Roswars
cooperation
is
emotionally
impossible.
Possibly
the
idea
was
in
<@203488399061942272>s
head.
Roswar
was
the
employer
of
Elsa
and
the
trial
against
Emilia-in
this
case
the
trial
was
aimed
at
<@203488399061942272>
but
it
could
have
attacked
the
mansion.
Elsa
appears
as
if
he
had
watched
<@203488399061942272>
arrive
at
the
mansion.
Be
aware
of
Fredericas
possible
death
and
the
existence
of
hidden
passages
and
Beatrices
library.
Arranging
them
only
Ram
or
Roswar
could
be
cited
as
suspects.
And
there
is
no
need
for
Ram
to
be
infatuated
with
Roswar
to
do
something
that
is
detrimental
to
Roswar
and
only
Roswar
remains
in
the
elimination
method.
--It
was
possible
that
you
should
have
thought
only
in
one
corner
of
your
head
in
the
sense
that
it
should
not
happen
more
than
you
want
it
to
come
off.
If
Roswar
was
the
employer
of
Elsa...
I
wonder
if
it
was
Rozwars
guide
in
the
royal
capital
where
Emilias
emblem
was
stolen
on
the
first
day
when
<@203488399061942272>
was
summoned.
If
<@203488399061942272>s
presence
in
the
Gospel
predicted
that
there
would
be
someone
with
the
power
to
return
to
death
and
it
was
necessary
for
Emilia
to
win
<@203488399061942272>
would
be
an
ally.
That
days
turmoil
was
needed
to
pull
him
in.
Was
it
all
on
Roswars
palm
that
he
ran
so
hard
on
that
day
died
three
times
to
help
Emilia
and
heard
his
name
with
Emilias
smile?
Everything
is
as
expected...
If
so
it
seems
that
Rem
was
robbed
of
his
existence
and
thus
was
blocked
in
all
directions
in
the
sanctuary
as
planned
by
someone...
If
so
isnt
even
<@203488399061942272>s
willingness
to
continue
to
work
so
hard
be
just
an
extension
of
someone
elses
thread?
The
future
answer
is
that
<@203488399061942272>
has
to
cut
off
everything
except
Emilia.
Now
that
the
road
to
get
there
is
cut
off
is
it
just
a
choke?
Im
an
idiot...
No
Im
an
idiot.
I
think
that
would
be
Rozwar
the
result
of
stopping
my
thoughts...
But
what
would
I
do
if
I
was
swallowed
by
it...
<@203488399061942272>
who
repainted
the
contents
of
the
Gospel
held
by
Petergius
is
the
best
example
of
the
fact
that
the
Gospel
is
not
absolute.
The
Gospel
accounts
that
show
the
way
to
the
future
are
not
all-purpose.
In
fact
if
something
different
from
the
description
occurs
Roswar
gives
up
on
the
world
and
throws
his
hopes
on
the
next
lap.
--e?
I
think
there
was
something
strange
right
now.
<@203488399061942272>
certainly
felt
awkward
as
he
slowly
went
through
the
process
and
pondered
about
the
Gospel
of
Roswar.
I
dont
know
what
it
is.
What?
Whats
wrong?
But
somethings
wrong...!
Feeling
like
a
mystery
with
an
invisible
answer
<@203488399061942272>
searches
for
the
light
in
the
haze.
Roswar
Gospel.
Do
as
described.
Beatrice
Gospel.
The
Gospel
of
the
Witch.
A
prophecy
book
in
which
the
owner
is
dead
and
the
destination
is
not
recorded.
Blank
page.
The
result
as
predicted.
The
result
is
not
as
predicted:
now
its
different
from
what
it
says.
No.-One
more
step
something
doesnt
come
out.
Although
I
feel
that
some
of
the
scattered
pieces
get
caught
they
all
scatter
without
forming
a
concrete
shape.
But
this
catch
is
something
you
shouldnt
overlook.
Each
of
the
cluttered
situations
that
have
occurred
many
times
before
I
was
able
to
pull
the
answer
from
a
small
clue
and
pave
the
way
through.
Also
this
time
each
of
the
fragments
will
surely
lead
to
an
answer.
--<@203488399061942272>?
e?
Suddenly
called
by
his
name
<@203488399061942272>s
consciousness
which
is
sinking
in
the
sea
of
u200bu200bthought
is
raised.
If
you
show
your
face
on
the
surface
of
reality
Emilia
who
shakes
her
shimmering
silver
hair
is
gazing
at
<@203488399061942272>
in
the
moonlight
pouring
into
the
darkness.
An
unexpected
encounter
sharply
aches
and
<@203488399061942272>
raises
his
hand
without
being
able
to
hide
the
surprise.
Ah
Emilia...Thats
why.
Here
it
is.
Its
been
a
long
time.
Thats
the
same
for
<@203488399061942272>
too.
If
you
stay
up
too
late
you
wont
grow
tall.
Im
probably
late
when
Im
at
the
end
of
my
growing
season
so
Im
a
little
worried
about
that...
As
usual
Emilia
shakes
the
topic
a
little
off
the
core.
Regaining
some
composure
to
her
response
<@203488399061942272>
naturally
steps
up
to
Emilia.
The
place
is
in
the
center
of
the
sanctuary
which
looks
like
a
small
square.
Leaving
his
hips
on
a
piece
of
stone
moss-covered
fountain-like
object
Emilia
sways
her
silver
hair
in
the
night
breeze
and
sends
it
to
<@203488399061942272>
next
to
her.
The
sad
purple
navy
blue
eyes
look
glossy
somewhere
and
bring
a
painful
sweet
urge
to
the
current
weakened
heart
of
<@203488399061942272>.
I
cant
sleep
Im
taking
a
walk...
What
happened
to
<@203488399061942272>?
...No
Im
that
kind
of
thing.
Its
a
type
where
I
cant
sleep
easily
when
the
pillow
changes
and
Ottos
snoring
is
surprisingly
noisy.
Its
surprising
that
<@203488399061942272>
had
such
a
delicate
nerve.
Emilia
smiles
with
her
hand
on
her
mouth.
Looking
at
the
profile
I
think
<@203488399061942272>
had
never
met
Emilia
again
on
the
night
of
her
return
to
death.
Basically
where
people
are
not
involved
in
<@203488399061942272>
the
behavior
of
other
people
follows
a
roughly
constant
flow
even
if
they
loop.
In
other
words
Emilia
always
went
for
a
walk
on
such
a
sleepless
night
on
the
first
night
when
she
tried
Trials.
While
being
invited
to
a
tea
party
being
violent
by
the
garfield
learning
about
the
identity
of
the
crowns
at
a
facility
in
the
back
of
the
forest
knowing
that
Roswar
is
behind
the
scenes
while
<@203488399061942272>
is
doing
various
things
The
change
was
coming
to
Emilia.
...
<@203488399061942272>
youre
not
doing
well.
Yes
I
wonder.
I
dont
mean
to
do
that.
No
it’s
a
lie.
If
it
were
the
usual
<@203488399061942272>
it
would
be
more
like
this.
I
dont
really
listen...
After
a
long
time
without
this
exchange
when
<@203488399061942272>
responds
while
relaxing
her
cheeks
somewhere
Emilia
smiles
pointing
at
her
cheek
Here.
I
finally
laughed.
<@203488399061942272>
I
always
tried
to
show
my
laughing
face
but
I
couldnt
do
it
that
way
now.
「――――」
Something
is
difficult...
Did
you
have
any
problems?
If
youre
happy
with
me
Ill
ask?
He
was
pointed
out
that
his
stiff
cheeks
had
loosened
and
<@203488399061942272>
suddenly
felt
the
words
of
concern
and
desperately
felt
as
the
inner
part
of
his
eyelids
gradually
became
hot.
Gentle
compassionate
words
flow
throughout
the
body.
In
the
current
situation
when
I
was
occupying
all
sides
I
couldnt
touch
my
hands
and
even
the
light
that
I
was
supposed
to
see
was
cut
off
I
felt
like
I
would
be
caught
by
my
lovely
palm
that
could
be
gently
extended.
I
couldnt
even
keep
up
with
the
intention
I
had
just
hardened
a
while
ago.
This
is...
my
problem.
I
cant
imitate
Emilia.
.........
I
think
its
the
one
thats
harder
than
me.
Im
so
upset
in
the
trial...is
that
okay
now?
Yeah
I
apologize
for
the
inconvenience.
Im
sorry
to
make
a
noise
Im
sorry?
It
was
as
if
my
heart
was
ready
for
a
problem
I
couldnt
do
at
all.
Emilia
responds
to
<@203488399061942272>s
distracting
smile
by
turning
her
face
away.
Then
she
put
her
hips
on
the
object
and
looked
up
at
the
night
sky
as
if
she
turned
away.
Really...I
thought
I
wasnt
prepared
at
all
so
I
thought
I
had
escaped
from
having
to
deal
with
a
lot
of
things
and
I
was
here.
I
dont
think
its
a
bad
thing
but
whats
wrong
with
running
away
from
what
you
dont
like.
If
you
continue
to
deal
with
something
you
dont
like
will
you
eventually
overcome
it?
If
I
find
a
different
way
to
escape
and
decide
to
go
that
way...
is
that
something
I
have
to
point
my
back
finger
to?
<@203488399061942272>……?
Quickly
Emilia
puts
a
nice
eyebrow
on
<@203488399061942272>
who
slips
his
tongue
out
of
control.
Emilia
is
puzzled
but
<@203488399061942272>
is
unaware
of
the
reaction.
Echidna
who
put
trials
in
the
graveyard
Roswar
who
pulled
it
because
he
knew
it
was
there
and
Garfield
who
bothered
that
he
had
to
get
over
it
were
always
selfish.
Even
though
you
guys
are
doing
whatever
you
want
why
do
we
have
to
be
swayed
and
when
we
try
to
do
something
in
our
own
way
were
complaining
that
we
cant
do
it...
I
dont
care.
「――――」
It
seems
like
my
head
is
going
flat
and
Im
about
to
get
rid
of
it.
Its
still
piled
up
with
problems
like
stacking
up...
After
all
Im
the
reason
why
Im
foolish.
―」
It
was
the
moment
when
my
emotions
raged
and
I
felt
even
dizzy
at
the
incomprehensible
resentment.
A
soft
palm
turns
around
the
back
of
the
head
and
the
body
is
pulled
down
by
the
sensation
of
pulling
the
head.
As
it
was
<@203488399061942272>
suddenly
held
his
breath
thrusting
his
head
into
the
soft
feeling
on
the
front.
A
terribly
hot
and
soft
touch
covers
<@203488399061942272>s
face.
I
heard
<@203488399061942272>s
heartbeat
from
the
warmth
that
touched
me
and
made
<@203488399061942272>
notice
that
my
white
thoughts
were
slowly
embracing
my
current
situation-Emilias
chest.
Oh--?
Slowly.
Quiet.
Listen
to
my
heart
because
its
okay.
--Hmm
Leave
yourself
to
a
certain
heartbeat
breathe
in
and
out
quietly
then
exhale...
Repeat.
When
it
calms
down
hit
my
back.
Until
it
calms
down
its
all
right.
The
whispering
voice
in
my
ears
runs
like
a
tickling
spine
and
<@203488399061942272>s
breath
rubs
against
me.
Although
the
emotional
sensation
blew
away
due
to
the
shock
<@203488399061942272>s
whole
bodys
blood
suffocates
instead.
What
is
causing
this
situation?
While
listening
to
the
quiet
beat
of
Emilia
my
heart
beats
my
ribs
with
a
very
sharp
and
sharp
rhythm.
However
the
heartbeat
evoked
due
to
such
agitation
naturally
relaxes
as
Emilias
breathing
and
the
palm
gently
stroking
the
back
of
the
head
unravel.
As
he
was
told
he
took
deep
breaths
breathed
in
and
out
and
<@203488399061942272>
adjusted
his
breath
and
heart.
Then
quietly
tap
Emilias
back.
With
that
signal
the
hand
that
touched
the
back
of
the
head
was
removed
and
<@203488399061942272>
woke
up
his
body
with
regret
Did
you
calm
down?
……somehow
<@203488399061942272>
exhales
a
small
sigh
in
front
of
the
bright
blue-blue
glow
in
front
of
her.
Emilia
smiles
at
relief
saying
Im
glad
to
<@203488399061942272>s
answer.
With
such
an
embarrassment
that
her
face
might
turn
red
<@203488399061942272>
shook
her
head
sideways
Im
sorry
but
I
didnt
want
to
bother
you
like
this.
I
dont
think
its
annoying
at
all.
But
Emilia
should
be
a
lot
harder
than
I
am.
Its
true...
I
thought
Id
try
to
help
you
in
that
hard
time...
I
thought
so.
<@203488399061942272>……
In
front
of
Emilia
there
is
myself
who
always
wants
to
look
good.
To
tell
the
truth
Im
always
eager
to
be
next
to
me
by
keeping
up
my
energies
that
are
dull
weak
selfish
and
lacking
everything.
It
just
went
wrong
and
I
was...
I
was
still
competing
with
Roswar.
I
was
wondering
if
I
could
get
out
of
the
sanctuary
without
a
trial.
e?
Really
it
would
have
been
best
if
I
could
take
over
the
trial...
but
I
couldnt
seem
to
do
it.
So
at
least
I
was
desperately
looking
for
it
but
it
was
also
difficult.
I
wonder
if
I
should...
Im
sorry
its
useless.
<@203488399061942272>--
lower
ones
head.
No
matter
how
many
times
I
had
the
opportunity
to
start
over
with
return
to
death
I
was
pitiful
of
myself
that
I
couldnt
find
a
single
bright
way.
If
we
were
doing
better
there
would
have
been
many
cases
where
the
sad
world
as
we
were
informed
by
the
second
“trial”
was
not
born.
Im
sure
that
we
could
find
a
way
to
do
it
even
in
the
mourning
ground
like
this
time.
But
Im
sure
Ill
do
something
about
it.
Ill
do
something
to
prevent
Emilia
from
feeling
painful
or
unpleasant.
So
trust
me.
……<@203488399061942272>
Oh
Emilia
moistens
her
eyes
and
looks
up
at
<@203488399061942272>.
Looking
back
at
their
wet
eyes
<@203488399061942272>
decides
not
to
twist
only
the
most
important
part
of
his
swaying
heart.
Protect
Emilia
overcome
the
sanctuary
save
the
mansion
and
regain
everything.
Its
a
road
where
no
light
is
visible
but
Im
sure
itll
be
manageable.
I
am
happy
with
<@203488399061942272>s
feelings.
Im
really
happy.-But
I
cant
accept
that
kindness.
However
the
determination
that
he
should
have
settled
was
denied
by
the
mouth
of
a
lovely
girl
who
had
a
strong
belief
in
her
eyes.
For
a
moment
<@203488399061942272>
couldnt
understand
what
he
was
saying
and
he
was
making
a
stupid
voice.
<@203488399061942272>
with
his
eyes
rounded
and
his
mouth
open.
As
Emilia
stares
at
such
a
<@203488399061942272>
he
wants
to
shape
his
thoughts
Im
so
happy
that
<@203488399061942272>
was
thinking
about
me
and
acting
like
that.
Its
very
reliable
Im
very
reliable....
But
Im
on
my
way
out.
Its
no
good
trying
to
find
it.
Well
its
useless...
to
impose
such
a
one-sided
problem!
I
decided
to
challenge
myself.
There
was
a
place
I
had
to
reach
and
there
was
a
barrier
I
had
to
go
to
to
get
there
and
now
I
have
to
work
hard
to
overcome
it.
For
that
I
dont
want
to
make
an
excuse.
<@203488399061942272>
is
shocked
in
front
of
Emilia
who
ties
her
lips
tightly
and
has
a
determination
in
the
twin.
Her
resolute
face
is
full
of
radiance
of
strong
will.
There
is
no
fragile
girl
who
can
walk
on
the
road
without
<@203488399061942272>
reaching
out
and
pulling.
why.
<@203488399061942272>
shook
his
head
as
the
words
of
doubt
filled
his
heart
I
think
Emilias
preparedness
is
worthy
but
that
trial
is
too
incompatible
with
you.
No
win...
I
dont
think
its
innocence
to
tackle
a
thin
battle
without
help.
...The
winning
eyes
are
still
looking
thin.
.........
With
no
words
to
repair
Emilia
smiles
at
<@203488399061942272>s
silence.
The
slight
drop
in
the
eyebrows
is
the
result
of
taking
honestly
my
evaluation.
I
couldnt
even
choose
the
words
to
follow
and
I
felt
like
a
terribly
lacking
person.
At
least
I
cant
wait
to
find
a
clue?
If
I
get
the
time
Im
sure...
Ill
make
a
better
situation.
Then
Emilia
feels
reassured...
Yeah
no
<@203488399061942272>.
I
know
somehow.-Im
sure
theres
no
shortcut
or
loophole
in
the
trial
of
that
grave.
「――――」
Mysteriously
but
I
know
that.
Even
if
I
take
time
if
Im
not
ready
to
challenge
Im
sure
that
the
result
will
be
the
same.
Ah……
No
negative
words
come
out.
I
dont
know
the
details
of
the
trial
in
detail
but
<@203488399061942272>
also
agreed
on
the
rules
Emilia
felt.
The
content
and
quality
of
the
trials
will
not
be
tempered
or
softened
after
repeated
challenges.
The
same
conditions
and
the
same
contents
welcome
the
challenger.
You
dont
change
the
nature
of
the
trial
and
you
get
different
results
with
just
one
mind
on
the
side
of
the
challenge-like
Echidnas
favorite.
It
was
surprising
to
<@203488399061942272>
that
he
was
overwhelmed
by
the
comfort
he
had
said
and
that
Emilia
had
grasped
the
essence
of
the
“trial”
more
than
he
had
imagined.
Nevertheless
if
<@203488399061942272>
desperately
tries
to
connect
the
words
Hey
<@203488399061942272>.-Why
does
<@203488399061942272>
try
to
help
me?
「――――」
The
questions
that
were
presented
in
advance
are
the
ones
that
have
been
given
before
and
have
important
meanings.
How
desperately
<@203488399061942272>
spent
to
give
the
answer.
How
hard
has
it
been
to
pass
it
on
to
Emilia?
So
<@203488399061942272>
can
answer
the
same
question
clearly
without
hesitation.
I
want
to
help
you
because
I
like
you-I
love
you
all.
-Hmm.
Yeah
I
know.
<@203488399061942272>
loves
me.
「――――」
Im
really
happy
with
the
feeling
of
<@203488399061942272>.
Its
very
reliable.
Its
dependable.
Just
because
<@203488399061942272>
sees
me
like
that
Im
sure
I
can
do
my
best.
With
his
hand
on
his
chest
and
a
slight
blush
on
his
cheek
Emilia
closes
her
eyes.
With
all
the
feelings
she
continued
the
words
So
Dont
feel
like
you
have
to
do
something.
I
can
do
my
best
just
by
watching
<@203488399061942272>.
If
you
want
to
do
something
listen
to
my
selfishness
stay
by
my
side.
I
want
you.
I
want
you
to
support
my
back.
Emilia...
If
you
feel
like
youre
fluttering
you
can
stop
if
you
have
a
hand
to
support
your
back.
I
want
you
to
be
near
<@203488399061942272>
when
you
shake
like
that.
「――――」
Thank
you
for
always
walking
in
front
of
me
removing
stones
so
that
I
wouldnt
fall
leveling
the
way
cutting
the
trees
and
trying
to
pull
out
my
hands.
I
think
Ill
end
up
with
the
slippery
<@203488399061942272>.
Im
rooted.
Zubo
la...
Im
trying
to
communicate
as
usual
but
no
words
come
out.
Inside
<@203488399061942272>s
chest
he
cannot
control
the
swelling
emotions.
What
is
it
that
is
hard
to
understand
that
cannot
be
put
into
words?
However
<@203488399061942272>
bites
his
back
teeth
and
continues
to
face
Emilia
so
as
not
to
root
his
emotions
that
strongly
insist
on
his
existence.
I
was
so
sweet
it
was
so
sweet...
so
Ill
try
not
to
do
it
again.
Every
time
I
make
a
mistake
Im
worried
about
<@203488399061942272>
and
everyone...
I
dont
think
so.
So
that
I
can
get
over
it
as
soon
as
possible.
To
<@203488399061942272>
who
cant
keep
up
the
words
Emilia
smiles
with
a
generous
smile.
Beside
me
who
works
hard
keep
an
eye
on
that
work.
Thats
what
I
want
<@203488399061942272>
to
do.
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
-------!
Cut
the
wind.
Leave
your
legs
leaning
and
your
heart
rushing.
He
ran
like
a
poorly
supported
slope
scratching
his
branches
against
his
cheeks
scratching
him
and
rolling
over
and
over
but
running
for
as
long
as
he
breathed.
-------!!
Raising
a
voice
that
does
not
turn
into
a
voice
opening
his
throat
with
tears
looking
up
into
the
sky
through
the
green
gap
that
obscures
the
darkness
staring
at
the
twinkling
moon
and
stars
in
the
clear
atmosphere
and
screaming.
――Thus
I
wanted
to
spit
out
the
foolishness
of
foolishness
from
my
body
and
make
everything
empty.
――Emilias
smile
which
she
showed
at
the
end
has
a
strong
determination
and
is
imprinted
on
her
eyes.
The
smile
the
preparedness
and
the
misconception
of
<@203488399061942272>
himself.
The
urge
to
swell
from
the
inside
which
burns
my
chest
is
finally
identified
when
they
come
together.
And
because
I
knew
the
identity
of
the
impulse
<@203488399061942272>
could
not
wait
and
could
not
wait
and
immediately
after
breaking
up
with
Emilia
I
jumped
into
the
forest
impulsively
and
ran
around
like
a
beast.
The
passion
is
that
people
are
not
allowed
to
stop
do
not
let
them
escape
even
to
sleep
and
are
likely
to
blow
fire
every
time
they
remember
Emilia-this
feeling
is
called
shame.
Shame
controls
the
whole
body
of
<@203488399061942272>
and
does
not
allow
him
to
stand
up.
I...I
am...!
Too
stupid.
Really
really
stupid
helpless.
When
Roswar
called
Emilia
down
and
called
him
<@203488399061942272>
was
furious
and
hung
over.
She
insulted
her
and
shouted
at
her
not
to
forgive
her
demeaning
words
and
attitude
and
she
stripped
her
fangs.
Immediately
after
the
exchange
I
met
Emilia
confessed
how
long
I
wanted
to
make
her
and
refused
it
and
I
realized
it
for
the
first
time.
――
<@203488399061942272>
had
the
least
trust
in
Emilias
determination
determination
and
strength.
I
have
to
protect
it.
I
dont
want
to
make
me
feel
sad
or
sad.
With
such
words
<@203488399061942272>
was
thinking
about
how
to
keep
Emilia
from
suffering.
If
you
try
to
take
over
the
trial
and
if
it
does
not
come
true
look
for
a
side
road
that
you
do
not
have
to
undergo
the
trial
and
if
that
seems
dangerous-at
worst
you
have
to
leave
the
sanctuary
I
was
only
worried
about
how
to
prevent
Emilia
from
hitting
the
trial
from
every
direction
if
I
could
manage
the
cause
the
rabbit.
While
<@203488399061942272>
is
selfishly
selfish
as
an
asylum
planning
to
protect
Emilia
Emilia
decides
to
embrace
Emilias
determination
and
determination
in
one
night
and
to
escape
from
the
trials
Although
it
was
said.
I
was
hoping
<@203488399061942272>
would
be
prepared
to
do
so.
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>
who
is
none
other
than
him
was
the
first
to
miss
the
girl
named
Emilia.
-------!
The
moment
he
noticed
that
<@203488399061942272>
was
struck
by
an
unbearable
shame.
An
embarrassing
response
was
given
to
Emilia
asking
for
an
answer
from
<@203488399061942272>
leaving
her
to
raise
her
hand
to
the
worried
her
and
escape.
And
with
that
foot
I
ran
into
the
forest
and
it
was
like
this.
In
the
former
capital
<@203488399061942272>
injured
Emilia
with
a
similar
selfishness.
Not
aware
of
Emilias
thoughts
or
readiness
he
was
struck
by
his
own
power
that
he
had
just
gained
and
did
not
tell
her
the
true
meaning
of
selfish
behavior
which
caused
a
separation
between
<@203488399061942272>
and
Emilia.
That
being
the
case
<@203488399061942272>
was
able
to
stand
in
this
place
now
as
she
established
the
feelings
for
her
and
how
to
express
her
feelings.
――And
yet
<@203488399061942272>
was
wrong
again.
Instead
of
Emilia
she
gets
hurt
takes
over
Emilias
hardship
and
creates
a
path
for
Emilia.
The
way
its
neither
emily
proud
nor
distracting
to
others
seems
to
be
a
little
more
advanced
than
it
was
before-in
fact
nothing
has
changed.
The
only
way
to
hide
hurt
is
better.
The
pride
of
telling
him
that
he
was
injured
was
nothing
but
hiding.
There
is
no
change
in
his
appearance
of
pushing
himself
to
Emilia
and
shouting
that
this
is
correct.
I
am...
me...
As
soon
as
I
was
out
of
breath
and
lifted
my
face
like
gasping
I
hit
<@203488399061942272>s
forehead
with
a
thick
branch
running.
At
the
moment
when
the
back
of
the
pain
is
bent
back
the
sensation
of
the
foot
collapses
and
scratches
the
air.
It
lays
sideways
rolling
on
the
soil
and
the
ground
covered
with
fallen
leaves
<@203488399061942272>
becomes
large
on
the
soil.
Put
your
back
on
the
cold
soil
so
that
you
can
absorb
the
heat
and
look
up
straight
into
the
sky
with
a
rough
breath.
You
can
see
the
night
sky
from
the
space
with
the
gaps
between
the
trees.
In
this
world
where
there
are
no
streetlights
stars
shine
powerfully
in
a
clear
atmosphere
that
pierces
the
skin.
Overlooking
the
sky
full
of
stars
<@203488399061942272>
is
surrounded
by
unfamiliar
constellations
and
melts
into
his
whimsical
uncertain
anxiety
terrifying
fear
and
a
vortex
of
mixed
emotions.
I
was
so
tired
that
I
couldnt
keep
my
consciousness.
It
was
an
angry
time.
Not
only
the
fatigue
accumulated
in
the
body
but
also
the
fatigue
accumulated
in
the
spirit
drags
<@203488399061942272>
into
the
darkness.
Return
to
death.
Witchs
Tea
Party.
The
true
meaning
of
Roswar.
And
Emilia
who
is
upset
and
prepared
to
stand
alone.
With
that
in
mind
<@203488399061942272>
himself
has
the
answer.
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
Its
really
good
isnt
it?
The
chills
and
whispering
voices
were
the
first
things
<@203488399061942272>
woke
up
from
sleep.
<@203488399061942272>
with
his
eyes
open
shook
his
eyelids
in
the
cold
sun
frowned.
Looking
directly
at
the
sun
peeking
through
the
flock
of
trees
I
tried
to
wake
up
with
teary
eyes
Oh
hurt...
A
squeaking
noise
from
his
stiff
joints
makes
<@203488399061942272>
moan
with
pain.
The
body
which
was
lying
on
the
solid
ground
was
stiff
here
and
there
due
to
the
coldness
of
the
soil
and
air
and
complained
of
dull
pain
every
time
I
tried
to
loosen
my
joints.
I
dont
know
what
it
means
but
I
dont
recommend
you
to
sleep
on
a
rooftop.
You
can
live
with
Gauran
on
the
roof
and
floor.
Gauran...
No
than
that
Shaking
his
head
<@203488399061942272>
casts
the
violent
voice
of
the
Lord-looking
down
on
<@203488399061942272>
sitting
on
the
ground
and
looking
up
at
Garfield
who
bites
his
canines.
At
the
same
time
the
awakening
of
consciousness
came
and
<@203488399061942272>
also
remembered
what
kind
of
situation
he
was
in.
Yeah...
I
fell
asleep
yesterday...
I
wondered
if
I
had
to
go
around
in
the
morning
routine
when
the
smell
of
temee
came
from
the
forest
I
wondered
what
I
would
have
done.
Its
not
like
that.
If
the
best
candidate
isnt
doing
it
nobody
would
do
it...
What
time
is
it
right
now?
Ask
Garfield
with
your
forehead
shaking
your
slightly
heavy
head.
Garfir
snorts
I
wasnt
impatient
I
guess
its
before
breakfast
time.
Im
afraid
Im
awakening
early
in
the
morning
babah
and
so
on.
If
so
I
shouldnt
go
back
or
make
a
fuss...
Before
I
happened
I
had
to
go
back
to
the
cathedral...
No
now
it
is...
If
<@203488399061942272>
didnt
return
in
the
evening
Otto
who
had
returned
earlier
might
be
suspicious
and
start
to
make
noise.
On
the
other
hand
I
dont
want
to
worry
about
the
refugees
in
Alam
Village
even
if
it
is
not
a
problem.
Its
the
worst
taboo
you
shouldnt
do
where
problems
can
lead
to
discord
and
discrepancies.
...Last
night
yesterday
Im
afraid
youve
looked
differently.
Ah?
Garfield
called
out
to
<@203488399061942272>
who
had
been
spinning
his
head
as
if
he
was
standing
by
a
tree
next
to
him.
Looking
back
he
scratched
his
short
blonde
and
scratched
Unlike
yesterday
when
I
didnt
know
if
I
had
enough
room
what
was
the
current
situation...
Im
going
to
have
a
refreshing
face.
「――――」
Oh
thats
something
wrong.
Shit
I
cant
say
it
well...
Hey
what
are
you
laughing
at?
Ku
haha...
<@203488399061942272>
puts
his
hand
on
his
cheek
as
Garfir
points
out.
He
felt
a
slight
looseness
in
his
mouth
and
exhaled
a
shivering
smile
from
the
back
of
his
throat.
It
seemed
low
and
stupid
then
it
got
bigger
Hahaha!
Am
I
refreshed!
Wow!
Whats
wrong
with
that...
Its
the
opposite
Garfeel.
Its
the
exact
opposite
at
all.
Ah?
<@203488399061942272>
puts
his
finger
at
Garfield
killing
the
urge
to
laugh.
And
I
didnt
do
anything
refreshing.
Inside
of
me
was
so
cramped
and
honestly
it
seems
like
Im
about
to
explode.
Ive
been
denied
everything
I
was
trying
to
do
and
I
was
motivated
to
do
it.
I
dont
really
know
what
to
do.
「――――」
When
I
realize
that
Im
really
stuck
Im
laughing
at
each
other.
If
everything
I
was
trying
to
do
wasnt
working...
from
the
beginning.
Muttering
weakly
<@203488399061942272>
drops
her
shoulders.
If
you
had
been
wrong
from
the
beginning
then
all
the
thoughts
you
have
accumulated
since
then
are
wrong.
It
was
too
late
to
realize
that
even
though
the
time
limit
at
which
we
had
to
overcome
the
problem
was
approaching
the
calculation
formula
was
wrong.
Whats
even
worse
is
that
the
problem
we
faced
up
again
seems
like
a
problem
that
we
havent
yet
learned
to
solve.
Garfir
wrinkles
his
nose
to
wonder
what
to
say
to
<@203488399061942272>s
sinking
appearance.
This
is
just
a
nuisance
as
we
know
that
when
we
ask
Garfield
we
dont
get
a
clear
answer.
Awkward
silence
falls
between
each
other-thats
when.
-
Can
you
tell
me
what
to
do?
-------!
Suddenly
<@203488399061942272>
looks
back
at
the
voice
coming
down
from
above.
The
reason
Garfir
looks
up
at
the
same
side
as
<@203488399061942272>
has
no
surprise
probably
because
he
was
aware
of
it.
Looking
at
the
point
of
looking
back
sewn
through
the
gaps
in
the
trees
and
walking
here
...Otto?
Yes
good
morning.
Yes
I
am.
A
dry
sound
of
treading
on
the
branches
sounds
and
Otto
with
a
whitish
smile
approaches
us.
<@203488399061942272>s
abrupt
appearance
makes
his
eyes
black
and
white
but
Garfir
bites
a
little
bit
To
tell
you
the
truth
I
didnt
even
find
it.
I
didnt
forget
about
my
brother
and
talked
to
him.
I
dont
doubt
that
way.
Natsuki-san
seems
to
have
found
it
in
a
state
where
it
doesnt
matter.
Whats
better
than
that?-Is
it
okay
to
ask?
...
say
it
Isnt
it
okay
to
have
Natsuki-san
alone?
I
have
something
to
talk
about.
In
front
of
<@203488399061942272>
who
is
not
able
to
swallow
the
situation
Otto
and
Garfield
talk
with
each
other
with
their
faces.
And
at
the
end
of
Ottos
offer
Garfeel
squeezed
his
teeth
and
then
glanced
at
<@203488399061942272>
Its
a
strange
imitation.
And
leaving
that
alone
I
keep
my
feet
from
this
place.
A
garfeel
that
steps
on
grass
goes
through
the
forest
and
returns
to
the
sanctuary.
Putting
his
back
on
him
and
seeing
him
in
a
squeeze
position
<@203488399061942272>
moistened
his
dry
lips
with
his
tongue
It
seems
like
I
could
talk
to
Garfield
before
I
knew
it.
While
Natsuki
is
fluttering
Im
not
saying
that
Im
not
doing
anything
either.
I
think
its
possible
to
deepen
interaction
with
the
people
here
and
those
who
have
evacuated...
well
Its
ok
According
to
<@203488399061942272>s
doubts
Otto
interrupted
his
hand
gesture
and
stared
at
<@203488399061942272>
with
his
twin
eyes.
No
my
eyes
are
too
strong
to
stare
at.
It
was
clearly
the
strength
of
the
line
of
sight
that
reached
the
glares.
what
is
it……
Due
to
the
uncomfortable
gaze
<@203488399061942272>
makes
a
weak
voice
while
muttering
his
words.
Otto
heard
that
and
sighed
a
little
The
story
is
fluffy
but
Ive
heard
it.
It
seems
like
Natsuki-san
is
being
hunted
down
for
a
long
time.
「――――」
I
dont
know
the
details
of
course
because
its
outside
the
mosquito
net
but
Im
stuck.
What
should
I
do?
I
heard
a
weak
sound.
If
so
what
are
you
doing...
I
was
wondering
what
to
do.
Listening
to
some
harsh
voice
of
Otto
<@203488399061942272>
mentions
his
first
statement
when
he
interrupted.
Otto
certainly
interrupted
the
silence
of
<@203488399061942272>
and
Garfir
by
saying
so.
Where
is
the
true
meaning
of
the
word?
You
know
what
to
do
you...
Yes
I
know.
Its
easy.
Easy...
do
you
want
to
know?
There
was
something
that
snapped
up
in
that
way.
Im
suffering
this
much
and
exposing
my
illness.
It
is
nothing
more
than
a
way
of
stroking
the
nerve
toward
the
opponent.
Oh
it
should
be
decided!
Its
foolish!
If
you
have
anything
to
know
tell
me...
If
so
Im
ready.
Ju
are
you
prepared...?
Yes.
First
take
a
slow
breath
and
take
a
big
breath...
Holding
his
hand
Otto
gives
<@203488399061942272>
a
deep
breathing
instruction
while
making
gestures.
Despite
the
incomprehensible
meaning
<@203488399061942272>
prepares
her
breath
to
obey
the
instructions
and
closes
her
eyes
to
inflate
her
lungs.
-------!?
The
next
moment
a
sharp
impact
punched
through
the
side
lying
<@203488399061942272>
on
the
ground.
<@203488399061942272>
fell
down
without
being
passive
and
<@203488399061942272>
turned
his
eyes
and
turned
his
eyes.
He
shook
his
head
looked
around
to
see
what
had
happened
caught
the
fist-shaking
Otto
and
realized
he
was
hit.
And
in
front
of
the
breathtaking
<@203488399061942272>
said
Otto
with
his
fist
turning
red.
Dont
wear
braces
in
front
of
your
friends
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>

<@203488399061942272>
was
stunned
by
what
was
happening
so
that
he
could
forget
the
pain
that
was
hit.
Otto
lying
sideways
on
the
ground
and
staring
at
<@203488399061942272>
raising
his
face.
It
was
a
fiery
flame
that
struck
my
eyes
with
a
look
that
didnt
look
miserable
laughed
at
me
and
never
showed
a
strong
emotional
color.
Otto
Souwen
was
angry
with
his
anger
overlooking
<@203488399061942272>.
I
dont
know
what
to
do
Im
crazy
in
my
head.
「――――」
I
just
have
to
reach
out
I
dont
have
enough
arms
head
or
power
and
Im
desperately
trying
to
fight
when
its
just
time
and
time.
Otto
squeezes
his
distance
as
he
throws
his
voice
at
the
silent
<@203488399061942272>.
<@203488399061942272>
who
is
crawling
up
can
not
move
and
he
can
only
look
at
Otto
while
frowning
at
the
feeling
of
his
left
cheek
that
begins
to
claim
heat
as
it
is
now.
Silence
is
an
affirmation
without
denial.
At
least
its
the
worst
thing
we
can
do
in
our
world.-Hear
it?
Otto
then
extended
his
arm
toward
<@203488399061942272>
who
had
no
words
grabbed
his
chest
and
pulled
it
up.
If
you
hear
me
reply
me!
-------!
A
sharp
hard
object
is
struck
on
the
forehead
and
sparks
scatter
the
field
of
view
of
<@203488399061942272>.
<@203488399061942272>
who
turned
his
eyes
realized
that
Otto
in
front
of
his
eyes
had
hit
his
head.
And
Otto
gives
another
shot
to
<@203488399061942272>
who
turns
his
eyes
and
gives
his
head
and
knocks
his
chest
away.
Pain
in
the
forehead
pain
in
the
cheeks
<@203488399061942272>
stepping
down
when
it
is
pushed
out.
As
expected
I
couldnt
just
keep
silent
up
until
now--
What
are
you
gonna
do...
Oh
I
was
conscious
of
the
fact
that
I
was
hit
and
left
but
I
was
conscious
of
it.
I
thought
that
I
was
sleeping
and
I
did
something
rough
and
unfamiliar.
What?!?
<@203488399061942272>s
anger
leaves
Otto
to
grab
while
tearing
her
eyes
from
the
second
head-butt
on
her
nose.
However
the
extended
arm
is
evaded
by
Ottos
movement
that
slides
sideways
and
conversely
he
is
violently
paid
under
his
feet
and
fallen.
Gau!?
If
you
think
that
blood
has
come
to
your
head
this
time
youre
at
a
loss.
Its
exactly
Natsuki-sans
behavior
its
pitiful.
Yes...is
that!
Standing
up
like
a
bounce
from
a
fallen
posture
<@203488399061942272>
throws
at
the
Ottos
face
with
the
soil
he
had
gripped
when
he
fell.
However
Otto
approaches
his
face
with
his
arm
as
he
was
also
reading
and
was
approached
by
<@203488399061942272>
who
was
late
to
start
the
next
move
due
to
the
surprise
that
the
blindfold
was
read.
Grab
the
back
collar
of
Breathtaking
<@203488399061942272>
and
put
your
hand
on
this
belly
and
throw
it
all
at
once.
Bounced
from
the
back
to
the
ground
the
bouncy
<@203488399061942272>
suffocates
with
shock
and
pain.
The
thrown
place
was
a
place
where
fallen
leaves
piled
up
but
of
course
not
all
of
the
shock
was
absorbed.
There
is
a
feeling
of
numbness
running
down
to
the
tips
of
the
hands
and
feet
and
<@203488399061942272>
who
is
panting
cannot
even
stand
up.
I
think
it
seems
like
Natsuki-san
isnt
it?
I
didnt
think
it
would
work
for
me
as
I
was
facing
each
other
with
that
in
mind.
...What?
Natsuki-san.
Thats
how
Natsuki-sans
power
is.
Its
no
match
for
the
knights
and
Roswar
let
alone
Garfeel.
Its
like
this
to
me.
<@203488399061942272>
desperately
sending
oxygen
to
his
convulsive
lungs
stabs
Ottos
words
shaking
his
head
as
if
he
was
surprised.
Otto
walked
up
to
<@203488399061942272>
who
could
not
argue
and
crouched
down
to
bring
his
face
closer
Its
ridiculous
to
set
things
up
with
white
whales
and
witch
religions.
Natsuki-san
is
weak
and
if
you
deal
with
each
other
properly
youll
probably
be
killed
with
a
fingertip
at
your
fingertips.
Youll
know
that.
「――――」
So
do
you
make
up
for
the
lack
of
power
with
wisdom?
From
my
point
of
view
Natsuki-san
seems
to
have
a
small
sly
head
but...
on
average
has
high
thinking
ability
and
judgment.
Well
thats
not
the
case.
I
dont
even
have
the
common
sense.
<@203488399061942272>
doesnt
know
what
Otto
wants
to
say
and
he
is
frustrated
with
his
rough
breathing.
Lung
spasms
thrown
shocks
and
slight
pain
in
the
forehead
and
cheeks.
Instead
I
do
not
understand
the
true
meaning
of
Ottos
words
which
are
thrown
in
one
after
another
as
the
calmness
returns.
Otto
continues
looking
down
on
<@203488399061942272>
who
has
dark
eyes
and
incomprehension.
I
dont
have
enough
power
or
wisdom
and
I
wonder
if
theres
anything
else
that
can
supplement
it...
I
dont
have
that.
Natsuki
is
a
small
short-handed
person
anywhere.
However
I
want
too
much
disproportionately
high
prices.
Oh
what
did
you
do...
If
you
dont
get
it
you
realize
that
youre
missing
something
and
then
you
wonder
what
youre
doing
with
your
second-best
idea
then
drive
yourself
further
and
pull
yourself
out
Sharpen...I
finally
understand
Patraschs
feelings.
Patrash...?
Given
the
name
of
the
Earth
Dragon
<@203488399061942272>
opens
his
eyes
with
surprise.
Patrash.
The
jet-black
earth
dragon
is
a
love
dragon
that
<@203488399061942272>
is
a
waste
of
and
it
is
hurt
to
help
the
Lord
who
has
fallen
into
a
predicament
and
it
is
important
for
<@203488399061942272>
who
shakes
his
head
if
there
is
no
reason
to
receive
such
a
thing.
The
benefactor
who
taught
me
is
also
an
dragon.
Otto
said
he
knew
the
feeling
of
Patrasche.
To
<@203488399061942272>s
eye-catching
eyes
Otto
put
his
finger
in
his
gray
hair
and
irritated
Thats
right...
with
a
thorn
in
his
voice
Its
fine
to
dress
up
in
front
of
a
loved
woman.
I
think
its
a
necessary
appearance
so
lets
respect
it.
It
is
unavoidable
to
want
to
say
imitation
or
words
that
do
not
fit
your
body.
Lets
overlook
that
much.
Its
Emilia.
It
is
<@203488399061942272>s
attitude
toward
Emilia.
Lets
also
allow
dressing
up
for
girls
who
like
me.
This
is
also
necessary.
I
think
that
a
loved
ones
love
is
liable
to
the
loved
one.
Because
its
important
to
dress
up
for
the
person
who
liked
you.
I
think
its
REM.
Once
<@203488399061942272>
said
the
same
in
front
of
Otto.
Youre
dressing
up
for
REM.
Because
she
is
a
girl
who
likes
herself.
But
thats
it.
In
short
Otto
approaches
his
face.
Again
Otto
looks
like
biting
into
<@203488399061942272>
who
shrinks
his
shoulders
to
eat
his
head
butter
I
dont
know
I
dont
know
I
dont
know
I
dont
know.
I
want
to
dress
like
a
child
I
like.
I
want
to
be
proud
of
the
child
who
likes
me.
「――――」
Then
I
should
help
the
children
with
something
that
makes
them
invisible
to
them.
For
example
with
friends.
Otto
releases
his
face
and
puts
his
palm
on
his
chest
to
convey
the
last
part.
In
his
words
<@203488399061942272>
exhales
ha.
To
be
honest
<@203488399061942272>s
thought
at
that
time
was
a
plain
impression
Is
that
so?
Its
not
that
Ive
never
thought
of
trying
to
entangle
or
rely
on
someone
like
that.
No
wonder.
As
Otto
says
<@203488399061942272>
is
aware
that
he
is
weak
and
lacking.
I
think
I
can
do
everything
by
myself
and
I
havent
evaluated
myself
if
I
havent
thought
of
it.
In
fact
<@203488399061942272>
might
have
sought
to
ask
Echidna
to
cooperate
with
Roswar
to
make
up
for
his
lack.
As
a
result
they
couldnt
get
the
help
of
them
and
on
the
contrary
<@203488399061942272>
was
hurt
by
being
told
the
truth
that
he
didnt
want
to
know.
Still
it
didnt
fail
the
solution
Otto
said.
Ottos
argument
is
wrong.
That
road
is
already
closed.
-Ha
Whats
wrong
with
that?
When
a
dry
conclusion
is
reached
in
the
chest
it
also
appears
in
form
on
the
cheeks.
<@203488399061942272>
looked
at
Otto
with
a
red
and
swollen
face
seeing
Ottos
eyes
unpleasantly
looking
at
it.
You
said
it
was
a
misunderstanding...
I
didnt
rely
on
anyone.
I
think
I
could
do
it
I
think
I
could
think
of
it.
I
wonder
if
I
can
rely
on
it.
Im
going
to
rely
on
that...
I
was
disappointed
in
my
expectations
and
still
couldnt
give
up
so
I
just
held
my
head.
Emilia
who
was
thinking
I
have
to
protect
and
I
need
to
help
at
the
end
of
the
phrase
was
denied
that
idea
and
I
looked
down
on
Emilia
as
a
weak
existence
that
must
protect
us.
I
have
noticed
that.
After
various
experiences
I
met
various
people
said
cool
things
barked
how
I
could
do
something
decided
to
live
by
denying
my
death
pretending
to
be
a
little
like
that
In
the
end
<@203488399061942272>
hasnt
made
a
step
forward
or
backward.
I
couldnt
find
any
way
to
change
the
situation
of
clogging.
Even
a
dry
smile
is
out
of
stock
and
<@203488399061942272>s
cheeks
are
covered
with
a
cold
and
hard
look.
Otto
shakes
his
lips
in
such
a
quiet
<@203488399061942272>
cry
...But
I
still
dont
remember
being
asked
by
Natsuki-san.
「――――」
I
dont
think
its
worth
it
it
doesnt
make
sense...
I
mean
I
was
dismissed
in
that
way.
Or
from
Natsuki-sans
point
of
view...
it
seems
like
I
should
protect
it
Is
that
the
target?
On
the
contrary
the
quivering
voice
buzzes
when
trying
to
kill
it.
Its
Ottos
anger
sadness
unfocused
passion.
Touching
the
aftermath
of
Ottos
overflowing
emotions
<@203488399061942272>
realizes
that
Otto
may
be
hurt
by
unintentional
words
and
immediately
shakes
his
head.
Wrong
Whats
the
difference?
Its
strange
if
it
doesnt.
If
it
doesnt
why
isnt
it
saying
why
Im
alone?
I
dont
tell
you
anything...its
not
because
I
dont
trust
you.
Its
different.
「――――」
Otto
is
silent
as
<@203488399061942272>
shakes
his
head
and
wanders
his
eyes.
But
Im
just
looking
at
<@203488399061942272>
with
green
eyes.
Afraid
of
the
pressure
of
his
gaze
<@203488399061942272>
muttered
his
words
and
put
his
hand
on
his
forehead.
Not
that
I
dont
trust
Otto.
I
am
very
grateful
for
the
kindness
of
the
people
who
are
trying
to
protect
<@203488399061942272>
in
their
loops
in
the
loop
and
who
are
dealing
with
the
current
situation
where
they
are
not
directly
connected
to
money.
I
cant
lie
with
my
friends
when
I
say
that.
However
how
can
I
tell
the
situation
now
to
Otto?
Anyone
who
knows
<@203488399061942272>s
circumstances
such
as
Echidna
or
Roswar
will
do.
This
is
because
even
if
you
speak
while
avoiding
the
content
that
touches
the
contraindication
conditions
it
will
be
established
as
a
conversation.
But
Otto
is
different.
Not
just
Otto.
Neither
Emilia
Rum
nor
any
other
people
in
the
sanctuary
know
anything
about
<@203488399061942272>.
We
cannot
explain
the
predicament
that
<@203488399061942272>
is
facing
without
telling
us
about
the
witch
and
return
to
death.
What
would
happen
even
if
we
were
told
that
there
was
a
big
rabbit
attack
or
an
assault
on
the
mansion
how
did
we
get
to
know
it
and
where
was
the
basis?
<@203488399061942272>
could
not
show
it
at
all.
In
that
situation
how
can
you
make
your
partner
believe
in
your
words?
Can
you
expect
such
a
thing?
There
is
a
lack
of
power
a
lack
of
wisdom
and
a
weak
self.
So
ultimately
<@203488399061942272>
must
be
able
to
achieve
his
wish
without
the
help
of
someone.
I
think
it
is
my
role
to
set
the
way
for
the
necessary
cooperation.
However
I
cant
play
the
necessary
role
and
my
legs
are
stuck.
I
cant
explain
anything
well.
Its
messed
up
in
my
head...
As
you
said
its
messy
or
nothing...
I
cant
give
a
meaningful
explanation.
.........
Even
if
you
talk
you
cant
believe
it...
What
and
how
should
I
talk...
so
nothing
to
you
or
anyone...
...Please
tell
me.
--e?
Otto
said
to
<@203488399061942272>
who
murmured
that
he
could
not
provide
any
evidence
or
grounds
for
his
belief.
Otto
looking
down
at
<@203488399061942272>
who
suddenly
raises
his
face
crosses
his
arms
Thats
why
Ill
tell
you.
Ill
listen
to
the
end
without
being
confused
messy
or
messed
up
in
the
middle
messed
up
in
my
head
so
that
I
cant
speak
reasonably
well
without
rounding
up.
No
but
then...
“That’s
what
it’s
like!
Otto
screams
as
he
kicks
the
ground
and
feels
patient.
Otto
put
his
finger
at
<@203488399061942272>
who
suddenly
turned
his
eyes
loudly
If
you
dont
have
the
evidence
to
trust
it
you
dont
have
the
basis
to
trust
it
you
cant
talk
in
theory
or
if
you
have
the
time
to
think
that
its
a
confusing
thing
youre
the
one
who
spit
out
all
of
your
head
But
its
a
lot
more
constructive
than
it
is!
Thats
right...I
am!
To
make
you
believe
in
the
mess...!
-Speak
all
the
mess!
And
at
the
end
you
can
say
believe!!
Im
a
friend!
――I
felt
that
all
of
the
emotions
which
were
filled
with
miscellaneous
things
in
my
head
were
overwhelmed
by
Ottos
screaming
voice.
The
word
is
too
groundless
and
theoretically
has
no
persuasiveness.
Still
there
was
something
enough
to
push
<@203488399061942272>s
back
who
could
not
move
and
stopped.
Believe
me
I
might
not
get
it...
It
didnt
take
long
for
me
to
talk
about
the
problems
I
had
alone.
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
On
top
of
that
Roswar
kills
the
mansion
and
attacks
the
house...
so
it
seems
like
hes
trying
to
drive
me
and
Emilia
into
an
escape-free
cousin...
Fearing
the
appearance
of
contraindicated
arms
<@203488399061942272>
finishes
the
situation
with
extreme
caution.
Meanwhile
Otto
continued
to
listen
to
<@203488399061942272>s
words
silently
wrinkling
his
brow
between
his
eyebrows
without
holding
his
mouth.
For
now
its
not
as
accurate
as
the
information
I
have...
but
its
all.
Anyway
hiding
it
everything.
Of
course
the
tea
party
with
the
witches
who
cant
talk
and
the
return
to
death
part
are
different.
It
can
be
said
that
there
are
holes
in
the
grounds
because
only
the
content
is
left
blank.
However
the
connection
between
the
information
was
so
vague
that
I
felt
uncomfortable
talking.
Thats
why
I
was
worried
about
Ottos
reaction.
How
did
Otto
who
asserted
that
he
had
to
add
believe
at
the
end
judged
the
current
story?
Mr.
Natsuki...
.........
After
a
long
meditation
he
unrolled
Ottos
arm
and
saw
<@203488399061942272>.
<@203488399061942272>
involuntarily
breathes
when
he
sees
himself
reflected
in
his
green
eyes.
Feeling
the
noise
of
the
heartbeat
how
the
first
word
is
spoken.
And
Otto
said
to
<@203488399061942272>
who
is
stiff.
Isnt
I
asked
not
to
run
away?
What-oh!?
Far
from
being
unexpected
<@203488399061942272>
shouts
with
a
diagonal
response.
However
Otto
shouts
Is
it!
``In
addition
to
being
trapped
in
the
place
where
the
rabbit
is
attacking
I
have
to
rely
on
the
delicate
Emilia
to
escape
through
the
“trial”
to
escape
and
at
least
I
will
try
to
move
even
those
who
do
not
get
caught
in
the
barrier
I
was
disturbed
by
the
house
and
when
I
managed
to
get
back
to
the
mansion
the
killer
came
over
at
the
command
of
the
owner
of
the
mansion...what
is
the
situation?!
I
dont
know!
I
dont
know
why
this
is
the
case
I
need
to
be
driven
into
a
situation!
I
knew
but
God
really
hate
me!
I
hate
me
too!
If
there
is
a
fate
god
he
definitely
hates
<@203488399061942272>.
I
dont
mean
to
hate
it
but
its
unreasonable.
However
the
situation
does
not
progress
recede
change
or
decrease
in
difficulty
even
if
you
hold
a
grudge
against
God.
And
before
that
Wait
Otto.
I
honestly
understand
how
you
make
that
kind
of
noise...
but
do
you
believe
in
this
ridiculous
story?
「――――」
Too
much
annoying
monsters
are
approaching
and
if
Emilia
cant
stand
up
to
escape
Garfir
prevents
him
from
escaping
and
Roswar
betrays
me
with
a
mysterious
idea...
Do
you
believe
such
a
story?
What
Im
saying
is
that
its
a
situation
in
which
only
the
most
inconvenient
situations
are
collected.
The
part
that
is
especially
problematic
is
the
attack
of
a
large
rabbit
that
can
not
show
the
basis
and
the
black
curtain
that
attacks
the
mansion
is
Roswar.
The
situation
is
that
the
fatal
problems
are
mainly
two
but
there
is
no
material
to
persuade
others
in
the
two.
Regarding
the
rabbit
how
did
you
catch
the
sign
of
the
demon
beast
that
everyone
in
this
world
wants?
With
respect
to
Roswar
how
is
he
going
about
a
scheme
that
would
be
a
disadvantage
to
Emilia
who
must
be
on
the
side
of
the
election?
Neither
of
these
can
be
explained
by
<@203488399061942272>.
Mr.
Natsuki
Ottos
eyes
for
a
while
answer
<@203488399061942272>s
question.
He
raised
one
finger
Ive
been
traveling
around
a
lot
of
different
lands
and
Ive
been
able
to
interact
with
a
lot
of
people.
...No
way
you
can
see
if
you
can
trust
it
with
your
eyes.
No
I
dont
believe
in
that
superstition.
When
youre
a
merchant
you
can
experience
more
than
enough
how
a
person
can
fool
or
fall
into
someone
with
a
cloudless
look.
I
also
have
a
lot
of
experience.
Im
proud
of
that
but
I
suppose
that
doesnt
mean
that
Ive
been
fooled.
I
couldnt
just
put
tea
in
the
middle
of
an
important
story
so
Otto
still
continued
with
<@203488399061942272>s
fluttering
mouth
Well
I
met
a
lot
of
people
like
that
and
I
had
business
talks
with
myself.
Its
been
four
years
since
I
left
my
parents
house
and
started
peddling
but
Ive
managed
to
survive
for
good
or
bad.
Otto
speaks
softly
but
it
probably
wasnt
an
easy
road.
Im
sure
there
were
many
times
that
it
was
directly
linked
to
life
and
death.
Its
a
world
where
you
can
encounter
white
whales
just
by
crossing
the
plains
so
you
can
imagine
how
dangerous
a
peddler
might
be.
Wild
dogs
night
thieves
and
threats
of
that
sort.
“In
those
days
Ive
lived
as
a
merchant
but...Im
confident
that
Ive
been
able
to
work
with
someone
who
can
calculate
that
they
have
a
high
chance
of
winning.
No
but
I
mean
if
you
think
I
have
a
win
the
result
will
not
come
because
of
an
unbelievable
disaster
after
that.
Hey
hey
hey...
Ive
decided
that
apart
from
good
and
bad
results
Ive
chosen
the
decision
so
that
it
doesnt
regret
it.
I
think
its
necessary
to
understand
and
deposit
something
or
bet
on
my
own.
Im
sorry
I
dont
know
what
Ottos
criteria
are
based
on
but
it
seems
that
hes
been
able
to
keep
up
with
the
ones
with
the
highest
chances
in
his
calculations.
The
fact
that
I
went
to
the
sanctuary
in
search
of
a
connection
to
Roswar
was
because
I
wanted
to
have
an
interview
with
Roswar
in
consideration
of
the
influence
of
the
future.
Otto
is
acting
as
a
realist
enough.
Thats
why
<@203488399061942272>s
words
that
are
unfounded
or
invisible
cannot
win.
So
this
is
my
first
time
Mr.
Natsuki.
--e?
As
for
what
he
says
<@203488399061942272>
opens
his
mouth
and
looks
at
Otto.
To
that
<@203488399061942272>
Otto
had
a
ridiculous
and
radiant
face
This
is
the
first
time
to
ride
on
a
blind
person
who
is
blind
to
the
odds
of
winning.
He
said
so.
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
My
legs
slip.
Im
out
of
breath.
The
body
of
<@203488399061942272>
was
winding
dragging
the
frustration
as
if
the
heart
was
following
on
the
grassland.
Cleave
the
cool
air
of
the
morning
shake
your
arms
and
step
forward
step
by
step.
Kick
the
soil
step
on
the
stones
and
straighten
the
poor
roads
that
are
evenly
graded.
Eventually
the
target
building
entered
the
sight
of
<@203488399061942272>
running.
The
cheeks
are
distorted
due
to
unintended
elation
and
the
teeth
are
exposed.
With
his
tongue
out
like
a
dog
and
his
breath
<@203488399061942272>
reached
out
to
the
entrance
of
the
building
to
jump.
And
--Roswar!
Roughly
open
the
door
<@203488399061942272>
rolls
into
the
building.
I
step
over
the
entrance
run
through
the
living
room
connected
to
the
sleeping
room
and
push
open
the
thin
door
with
the
power
that
can
break.
In
the
sleeping
room
there
was
Roswar
who
raised
his
body
in
bed
and
Ram
who
looked
after
the
Roswar
with
great
effort.
It
is
unusual
for
Roswar
who
is
usually
sloppy
and
Lam
who
is
wearing
a
blank
faceless
iron
to
be
struck
by
the
void.
Now
that
were
trying
to
do
something
like
never
before
its
a
good
thing.
By
linking
their
surprises
to
such
positive
thoughts
<@203488399061942272>
points
his
finger
towards
a
master-slave
who
still
has
no
words
Lets
place
a
bet.
Your
wishes
on
me
and
your
chips
A
breath
of
breath
and
a
surprising
glance
at
<@203488399061942272>
as
he
jumps
into
the
room.
Both
were
thought
to
be
far
from
being
astonished.
The
reaction
made
me
feel
refreshed
and
deepened
the
ferocious
smile
I
had.
--Bet?
The
roar
that
lie
on
the
bed
is
murmuring
and
narrowing
the
eyes
of
different
colors.
The
face
that
should
normally
have
been
made
with
clown
makeup
is
now
removed
and
the
bare
face
is
exposed.
Its
Roswars
real
face
Ive
seen
only
once
during
the
looping
time.
The
skin
under
the
white-painted
makeup
is
pale
and
the
face
with
the
eyeline
erased
is
more
like
a
simpleness
than
a
sharpness
which
is
too
different
from
the
impression
of
individual
Roswar.
The
face
which
looks
highly
calculated
and
has
a
stinky
personality
during
makeup
quickly
turns
into
a
simple
young
man
who
seems
to
be
naive
just
by
removing
makeup.
While
subtly
measuring
the
real
face
of
Roswar
with
a
heart
saying
that
the
beauty
is
beautiful
without
doing
anything
<@203488399061942272>
pulled
his
chin
to
Roswars
murmur
Yes
its
a
bet.
Im
asking
you
and
me...
Serious
one
shot
game.
「――――」
With
one
finger
raised
<@203488399061942272>
proudly
declares
to
Roswar.
Roswar
squints
and
looks
at
<@203488399061942272>s
proposal.
But
before
Roswar
tells
me
something
its
Lamb
the
maid
with
peach
hair
who
breaks
in
between
the
two
eyes.
The
color
of
the
line
of
sight
of
Ram
facing
<@203488399061942272>
with
Roswar
behind
is
severe.
Usually
Rams
line
of
sight
is
sharp
to
adapt
to
<@203488399061942272>
if
there
is
a
gap
but
now
it
is
not
comparable
to
those
times.
Wait
Barus.
Suddenly
I
rushed
into
the
room
and
wondered
what
I
was
trying
to
say...
Im
going
to
put
a
burden
on
Roswar
who
is
being
treated?
Its
too
disrespectful.
The
sick
and
injured
person
is
not
a
good
reason
to
get
out
of
hand
when
considering
the
current
situation.
The
slipping
of
the
tongue
and
the
blackness
of
the
belly
have
nothing
to
do
with
it...
Barth--
Who
is
told!
A
rum
with
a
blend
of
irritation
and
swordsiness
in
your
eyes.
However
before
she
moves
<@203488399061942272>
stomps
in
a
high
pitch
by
taking
the
initiative.
Be
vigilant
point
at
the
ram
that
stops
your
feet
I
have
no
reason
to
stop
or
hesitate.
That
should
have
been
between
you
and
me
Roswar.
--HM
Or
do
you
feel
like
youre
unfaithful
just
because
the
contents
are
a
little
different
from
the
diary?
Whats
the
point
of
doing
it
for
the
sake
of
the
followers?
...Interesting
thats
the
case.
Im
the
one
who
follows
me.
<@203488399061942272>
makes
words
to
reach
Roswar
without
directly
touching
Return
to
Death.
Rum
squints
to
show
incomprehension
but
Roswar
seems
to
have
scored.
When
the
bloody
expression
faintly
returned
to
the
expression
that
was
lacking
in
vitality
Roswar
spoke
to
the
back
of
Ram
standing
in
front
Rum.
Please
refrain...
No
I
wonder
if
you
can
appear
in
the
table.
...Well
Roswar-sama
Its
ok.
Its
okay.
<@203488399061942272>
isnt
sane
enough
to
attack
me
just
because
theyre
alone.
Its
easy
to
get
back.
Ah
its
a
pity.
If
youre
competing
with
force
you
dont
have
the
confidence
to
drag
it
out
of
bed.
To
<@203488399061942272>s
affirmative
by
waving
his
empty-handed
hands
Ram
distorted
his
cheeks
as
if
to
bite
his
teeth
and
then
turned
his
worried
gaze
to
Roswar
again.
Please
do
not
overdo
it.
I
told
him
that
much
and
bowed
to
the
exit
of
the
room.
Immediately
before
passing
through
<@203488399061942272>
glance
at
<@203488399061942272>
for
a
moment
--I
dont
know
if
theres
something
like
Roswar.
I
want
him
to
worry
about
whether
hes
done
something
to
despair.
<@203488399061942272>
shrugs
off
the
exiting
ram
sees
the
door
closed
and
<@203488399061942272>
turns
to
Roswar.
Roswar
keeps
his
thoughtful
face
catches
one
eye
and
projects
<@203488399061942272>
on
his
yellow
eyes
I
think
the
look
that
I
saw
at
the
time
of
parting
last
night
is
also
very
different.
Its
just
a
matter
of
hours
is
it
a
change
of
state
of
mind?
I
dont
think
its
a
change
of
feelings.
I
had
a
preaching
and
had
a
friendship
by
fighting
with
each
other.
Touching
Ottos
cheeked
cheeks
reminds
me
of
the
feeling
of
this
morning
with
a
slight
redness.
Unexpectedly
Ottos
physical
strength
is
quite
good
as
he
looks
terrible.
Maybe
its
the
difference
in
the
number
of
shrubs
that
have
gone
through.
Since
<@203488399061942272>
has
come
to
this
world
he
intends
to
pass
through
the
shrines
but
it
seems
that
it
is
still
short.
Thats
it
what
a
magnificent
world...
Yes
thats
right.
Well
I
confirmed
yesterday
that
I
may
not
be
able
to
drive
in
well
but
it
seems
that
it
was
not
a
mistake
to
think
that
returning
too
soon.
I
was
at
the
limit
but...I
mean
its
just
simple.
With
Ottos
words
and
fists
the
twisted
and
bent
guts
have
been
revamped.
I
think
it
was
terribly
violent
and
simple.
It
was
kind
of
stale
that
my
friend
beat
me
to
correct
the
road
and
Im
sure
it
would
have
been
a
ridiculous
thing
for
other
personnel.
But
I
dont
think
its
bad.
It
feels
like
the
deadlock
is
so
great
that
its
nice
to
be
able
to
find
it
with
the
help
of
a
friend.
Its
sweet.
Its
blue
and
young....
Ultimately
the
suffering
of
this
world
can
only
be
solved
by
yourself.
You
dont
need
to
have
a
weak
idea
such
as
relying
on
a
friend.
Relying
on
people
relying
on
ties
relying
on
feelings...
so
its
useless?
No!
Thats
right.-Then
I
have
to
fight.
The
expression
of
Roswar
changes.
<@203488399061942272>
stepped
in
and
walked
up
to
Roswar
on
the
bed
flipping
his
finger
and
making
a
sound
and
struck
him
into
Roswar.
Lets
bet
as
I
said.
I
want
a
tip
and
only
one
bed.
Just
listen
lets
not
hear
After
seeing
Roswar
not
kicking
the
proposal
out
of
his
head
<@203488399061942272>
points
his
finger
at
the
ceiling
and
examines
the
preconditions.
This
time
I
cant
live
up
to
your
wishes.
Not
only
this
time
Im
not
going
to
keep
up...
but
even
if
I
insist
that
its
a
parallel
line
with
you.
So
lets
break
the
deadline.
Due
date?
<@203488399061942272>
nod
to
Rozwar
who
asked
back.
Moisturize
his
lips
with
his
tongue
<@203488399061942272>
glances
at
Roswars
twins
straight
In
this
lap
I
pierce
my
way.
If
it
breaks...
Ill
do
whatever
you
want
next.
Thats
the
deadline.
-Is
it
that
you
who
have
the
power
to
start
over
renounce
that
right?
I
told
you
too.
I
dont
have
enough
ways
to
be
driven
in.
I
think
so
too.
Of
course
I
have
no
intention
of
denying
that
idea.
What
can
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>
do
in
this
cruel
world
without
Return
to
Death?
I
do
not
intend
to
deny
the
benefits
of
return
to
death
nor
do
I
shamelessly
imitate
them.
I
just
changed
my
mind.
Do
what
you
do
and
if
its
the
final
return
to
death
accept
it.
But
if
not
if
you
die
before
you
survive
Its
a
blasphemy
for
those
who
cry
for
me.
I
cant
do
it
anymore.
To
that
end
I
have
to
limit
myself...
I
see.
Its
a
good
condition
for
me
to
wish
or
fulfill
but
what
is
the
guarantee
to
protect
it?
Guarantee
Yes
its
a
guarantee.
Its
important
right?
Well
you
can
redo
it.
You
can
even
make
this
promise
because
you
didnt.
You
failed
you
redo
and
you
returned
last
night.
You
could
just
try
another
method...
Roswar
<@203488399061942272>
called
in
a
quiet
voice
the
name
of
Roswar
who
was
concerned.
Roswar
who
cut
the
words
in
response
to
the
call
looks
slightly
at
the
eyes
of
<@203488399061942272>
looking
at
himself.
And
<@203488399061942272>
piles
up
without
changing
the
tone
of
his
voice.
Do
you
think
I
will
do
that?
「――――」
If
I
think
Ill
do
that...
the
story
wont
work.
Thats
it.
Roswar
squints
at
<@203488399061942272>s
words
then
gently
raises
his
hands
and
sighs.
He
continued
the
words
No
no
Lets
hear
the
rest
of
the
story.
You
can
make
the
final
decision.
...Oh
do
it.
Just
like
I
said
Ill
break
the
deadline.
Ill
pour
everything
in
this
one
time.
If
no
Ill
do
it.
Either
way...
If
it
doesnt
work
I
probably
dont
have
it
anymore.
Im
not
confident.
Im
just
prepared..
Well
Ill
have
to
comply
with
it.
Well
youre
deadline
and
this
is
the
last
time.
Then
I
wonder
what
Im
asking
for.
Somehow
Roswar
is
starting
to
return
to
his
usual
tone.
<@203488399061942272>
clapping
their
hands
while
exchanging
each
others
intentions
in
negotiations
and
discussions.
“My
request
has
come
simple.
If
this
time
my
way
breaks
through
the
spelled
future
will
be
different
from
what
you
want.
If
that
happens
you
have
the
energy
to
live
in
a
different
world
than
the
Gospel.
I
wonder
if
he
loses
that...
No
no.
I
mean
dont
you
motivate
me?
I
see
I
cant
help
saying
that
its
difficult
as
a
requirement.
Of
course
its
possible
to
repair
on
the
surface.
But
how
much
Im
in
my
heart...
Aside
Roswar.
I
dont
want
to
be
an
enemy
with
you
all
the
time.
--Yup?
Rozwar
twists
his
head
when
he
doesnt
understand
<@203488399061942272>s
case.
In
response
to
Roswars
attitude
<@203488399061942272>
rubs
his
nose
with
his
fingers
I
know
that
the
future
is
different
from
the
Gospel
and
I
hate
that
you
have
a
definite
future
and
the
route
is
off.
But
even
in
a
future
that
is
different
from
that
Gospel
Im
lying
sideways
to
make
Emilia
the
King.
Im
going
to
keep
messing
around.
Even
with
the
power
of
redoing
Im
sure
to
rely
on
it.-Aside
from
the
process
the
final
result
is
surely
out
of
your
aim.
「――――」
Roswar
my
request
is
simple.
If
I
open
up
a
future
in
a
way
different
from
the
Gospels...
you
throw
away
the
Gospels
and
come
with
me.
To
make
Emilia
the
King.
Power
is
needed
No
matter
how
much
Roswar
puts
into
unforgivable
deeds
his
power
is
necessary
for
Emilias
goals.
As
a
<@203488399061942272>
person
I
sometimes
hate
that
I
cannot
understand.
Even
on
this
timeline
if
left
undisturbed
his
tactics
will
create
an
irreversible
situation.
――However
that
situation
is
picked
up
by
<@203488399061942272>s
own
hand
and
a
decisive
groove
is
avoided.
Roswar
took
a
deep
long
breath
at
<@203488399061942272>s
suggestion.
With
his
eyes
closed
and
thoughtful
he
touches
his
chin
and
slowly
opens
his
lips
The
final
drop-off
you
want...is
that?
Its
a
convenient
story.
I
love
that
convenient
story
I.
Emilia
will
do
her
best
to
become
the
King
and
I
will
bless
it
next
door
and
be
one
of
those
around
you.
Its
a
difficult
proposal
for
me
who
has
been
doing
one
method
for
a
long
time
a
long
time.
Im
trying
to
move
me
like
that...
Conditions
are
strict
right?
Oh
yes.
<@203488399061942272>
nodded
to
Rozwar
with
one
eye
and
raised
his
two
fingers.
Feeling
that
Roswars
line
of
sight
was
concentrated
on
the
tip
of
his
finger
<@203488399061942272>
gently
shakes
one
of
his
standing
fingers
There
are
two
conditions.
You
cannot
it
is
impossible
two
such
conditions.
When
you
clear
those
conditions
the
bet
is
my
win.
And
if
the
conditions
arent
met
then
Im
the
winner.
You
ask
for
humanity.
Roswar
looked
at
<@203488399061942272>
with
both
eyes
speaking
in
a
low
and
heavy
tone.
Nodding
<@203488399061942272>
bites
his
teeth
and
cuts
out
in
front
of
the
line
of
sight
urging
Roswars
tip.
First
the
first
condition.-Garfeel
is
attached
to
an
ally
and
taken
out.
「――――」
You
couldnt
take
him
out
of
the
sanctuary
to
get
it
out.
I
think
so.
I
think
so...
but
he
still
needs
the
power.
Considering
our
emotions
we
cant
leave
him
as
a
mess.
Ill
do
what
Garfeel
convinces
you
that
you
cant.
--The
second
is
The
moment
I
heard
the
first
condition
there
was
a
dark
emotion
behind
Roswars
eyes.
However
<@203488399061942272>
nods
to
Roswar
who
seeks
the
next
condition
without
mentioning
it
-Emilia
breaks
the
trial.
It
is
Emilia
who
overcomes
the
trial
of
the
graveyard
and
releases
the
sanctuary.
Thats
not
me.
Impossible!
Aloud
Roswar
slammed
the
bed
with
his
palm.
Roswar
makes
a
dry
sound
and
distorts
the
face
into
anger.
He
got
angry
at
his
shoulder
and
thrust
his
finger
towards
<@203488399061942272>
I
must
have
told
you
last
night.
I
cant
break
through
the
trial
to
Gare
and
Garfield
cant
let
go
of
the
obsession
with
sanctuary!
Thats
exactly
what
I
need
to
do.
Yeah
its
something
I
have
to
try.
And
because
youve
done
it
so
many
times
you
might
have
been
struck
by
ah
in
front
of
me!
Is
that
you?
And
this
is
your
readiness
to
prove
that
they
arent
worth
the
hope!
Roaring
his
shoulders
up
and
down
he
shouted.
In
his
appearance
of
repeated
rough
breathing
but
<@203488399061942272>s
face
was
still
calm
Dont
be
angry
with
enthusiasm.
What
did
you
say……?
For
you
it
would
be
better
if
my
conditions
were
stricter.
It
would
be
wrong
to
get
angry
that
the
conditions
are
strict.
Its
the
dimension
of
whether
or
not
a
bet
will
be
made.
If
the
legitimacy
rather
than
the
disadvantage
can
ruin
the
outcome
of
the
bet
its
no
wonder
that
Im
careful.
Roswar
seems
distrustful
of
the
conditions
that
<@203488399061942272>
is
too
unfavorable
and
too
favorable
for
him.
However
<@203488399061942272>
distorted
his
cheeks
due
to
Roswars
reaction.
He
smiled
deeply
and
ferociously.
Roswar
seems
to
be
misunderstanding.
.........
Im
too
disadvantaged?
Certainly
its
definitely
a
difficult
condition
to
see.
Its
not
like
I
cant
think
of
your
long-term
plan
as
if
youre
going
to
fix
it.
Its
not
that
there
isnt...
but
its
another.
<@203488399061942272>
smiles
at
the
silent
Roswar
You
said
Roswar
「――――」
I
was
driven
in
and
it
becomes
the
strongest
card.
-Your
opponent
doesnt
look
like
you
wanted
it
but
it
must
be
the
strongest
card.
So
youre
still
dissatisfied?
Roswar
is
silent
to
<@203488399061942272>s
remarks
when
he
breaks
the
pond.
However
he
is
keeping
his
breath
in
gazing
at
<@203488399061942272>.
Then
the
calm
Roswar
with
one
finger
up
--Contract
「――――」
Okay.
Lets
take
the
condition
you
presented
now.-Freeing
Garfir
from
the
spell
and
Emilias
sanctuary.
Lets
abandon
my
plan
and
follow
the
path
you
make.
A
faint
light
shines
on
the
tip
of
the
raised
finger.
Manas
concentration
iridescent
resembled
the
light
that
Julius
once
created
when
he
destroyed
Petergius
the
light
produced
by
bundling
multiple
attributes.
Through
the
gates
well
engrave
each
others
contracts
in
our
souls.
We
cant
deceive
our
hearts
by
deceiving
anyone
else.-The
contracts
engraved
in
our
souls
can
go
beyond
distance
time
and
even
the
world.
I
will
continue.
It
will
be
effective
even
for
your
rework.
Well
maybe
there
is
a
way
to
do
something
about
it...
But
thats
better
for
me
too.
If
you
bind
each
other
with
a
contract
youll
beat
the
betting
losers
with
a
crap.
You
can
save
time.
I
dont
seem
to
look
at
it
lightly...
I
think
its
okay.
Roswar
does
not
tell
much
about
<@203488399061942272>s
stance
of
accepting
the
contract.
The
shining
of
the
fingertips
is
applied
to
the
center
of
<@203488399061942272>s
chest
from
which
something
crawls
into
the
body.
Immediately
afterwards
<@203488399061942272>
exhales
feeling
a
wave
like
a
pore
in
the
whole
body
opening
from
the
inside.
AHA--
Similarly
engrave
in
my
soul.-When
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>s
contract
is
fulfilled
Roswar
L.
Matherss
contract
is
also
fulfilled.
Similarly
a
rainbow-colored
light
shines
on
Roswars
chest.
For
a
moment
the
light
propagates
through
Roswars
entire
body
and
it
returns
to
its
original
form
immediately
after
the
blink.
Is
this
the
end?
Its
over....I
cant
turn
back
anymore.
<@203488399061942272>
takes
a
small
breath
as
he
confirms
that
they
have
drawn
a
line
that
cannot
escape.
And
Roswar
puts
his
hand
on
his
chest
I
will
also
act
to
finalize
the
Gospel
account
just
as
you
do
my
best
to
fulfill
the
conditions.
Do
you
blame
me
for
that?
-Is
it
possible
to
reproduce
the
snowfall
after
five
days?
...If
Emilia
doesnt
let
me
down
Ill
do
it.
In
other
words
the
time
limit
has
been
set.
Five
days
later
a
big
rabbit
comes
in.
By
then
Emilia
must
release
the
sanctuary
and
<@203488399061942272>
must
release
Garfir
from
spells.
If
I
decide
to
do
so
Ill
be
scared
of
time.
Ill
take
action
and
start.
<@203488399061942272>
Roswar
calls
<@203488399061942272>
who
is
about
to
leave
the
bed
and
begin
to
act.
Looking
back
at
<@203488399061942272>
Rozwar
diverted
his
eyes
slightly
The
mansion
is
on
the
same
day.-At
best
I
wish
you
a
good
fight.
I
think
the
one
who
messed
up
with
it
would
behave
as
you
expected
in
the
next
round...?
「――――」
Roswar
replied
silently
to
<@203488399061942272>s
reply.
He
smiled
at
that
attitude
and
then
<@203488399061942272>
finally
pointed
at
Roswar
Roswar
Im
out
of
tune
so
put
on
a
clown
makeup
again.
Hmm
yeah...Isnt
this
the
first
time
Ive
been
in
touch
with
you?
Yes
in
this
world
The
subtle
words
of
<@203488399061942272>
found
Roswar
to
open
his
eyes.
<@203488399061942272>
started
walking
feeling
the
reaction
on
his
back.
Its
your
match
with
me.
The
clowns
are
at
the
mercy
of
their
destiny-lets
do
it
right
and
right.
Leaving
so
I
leave
the
room.
The
betting
conditions
are
met.
――So
it
starts
here.
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>s
last
challenge
to
release
the
sanctuary
Woman
there
was
one
woman.
The
woman
was
worried
about
everything.
I
was
worried
about
people
fights
the
world
everything.
Everything
looked
small
to
the
woman.
Everything
everyone
seemed
like
a
child
to
protect.
It
is
easy
to
control
such
people
and
the
world
which
will
scatter
with
your
arms.
But
the
woman
decided
to
use
her
arms
for
asylum
not
for
control.
The
struggle
for
the
womans
lone
army
has
begun.
The
trial
and
error
after
that
was
not
easy
for
a
woman.
Guide
people
connect
people
help
people
advise
people.
In
any
case
it
is
not
enough
for
a
woman
alone.
Out
of
reach
I
cannot
reach
what
I
should
do.
For
the
first
time
a
woman
curses
her
lack
of
strength.
Even
if
I
can
see
the
danger
I
dont
have
enough
hands.
You
cannot
save
even
if
you
are
in
a
predicament.
The
lack
of
power.
Even
if
it
arrives
in
front
of
us
we
cannot
fill
the
distance
that
it
does
not
reach.
Even
if
we
can
see
everything
we
cannot
change
what
has
already
happened.
There
is
no
life
to
deal
with
the
disaster
far
away.
I
believed
that
I
had
power.
It
didnt
quite
reach
my
wish.
When
he
had
the
wisdom
It
didnt
show
the
way
for
the
desire.
Therefore
the
woman
despairs.
I
devote
myself
to
the
curse
for
my
lack
of
strength.
Being
struck
by
all
kinds
of
remorse
endlessly
torn
by
the
lamentation
of
others.
Eventually
the
woman
will
understand.
Its
impossible.
It
impossible.
I
cant.
This
was
a
long-cherished
desire
that
was
beyond
the
scope
of
a
womans
hand
and
that
even
her
wishes
were
unfit.
I
knew
it.
There
was
understanding.
I
realized
the
impossible.
――But
do
not
give
up.
If
you
are
not
enough
alone
increase
the
number.
If
you
do
not
stand
alone
you
can
reach
undesired
wishes
by
collecting
items
with
the
same
wish.
The
head
is
clear.
You
can
see
what
you
couldnt
see.
With
this
wish
lets
pick
up
the
unreasonable
lamentation
the
tragedy
that
cannot
be
saved
and
the
repeated
cruelty.
He
teams
up
with
the
instigator
gives
the
sword
a
battlefield
trades
with
the
dragon
and
pursues
a
long-cherished
desire.
A
long-cherished
conclusion
that
will
eventually
come.
The
end
of
the
vow
that
should
come
soon.
Eventually
the
long-awaited
fulfillment
of
a
long-cherished
desire--.
Save.
Lets
save.
You
can
see
the
way
to
save.--I
know
the
way
to
save.
In
the
process
no
matter
how
much
you
hurt
or
lose
it
you
just
give
up.
Even
if
the
instigator
disappears
the
Tenken
forgets
to
smile
and
the
dragon
flies
away
into
the
sky
he
will
not
give
up.
Getting
rid
of
the
first
supporter
will
keep
you
on
track.
The
woman
is
no
longer
alone.
It
should
be.
I
know
what
it
was.
I
want
to
know
it.
Walk
on
the
road
paved
by
countless
bodies.
Aiming
to
fulfill
a
long-cherished
desire
at
the
expense
of
many
lives.
Eventually
all
tears
should
be
accessible.
When
you
do
that
there
is
a
world
to
understand.
Only
then
can
the
original
wish
be
reached.
So
in
search
of
it
desperately
the
woman
endures
the
intolerable
pain
and
continues
struggling.
--The
Greedy
Witch
burns
for
unreachable
wishes
and
continues
to
shed
his
own
greed.
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
-Julius
should
take
a
rest
here
until
the
wound
heals!
Absolutely
absolute!
Emilia
said
slamming
the
tattered
Julius
into
the
green
room
and
making
a
loud
voice.
A
long
staircase
from
the
second
layer
Electra
to
the
fourth
layer
<@203488399061942272>
and
Julius
who
left
it
down
with
their
shoulders.
Its
an
exchange
right
after
Emilia
was
relieved
to
welcome
the
two.
Its
a
virtue
to
change
your
feelings
quickly
and
Im
grateful
for
the
fact
that
you
cant
tell
whether
youre
there
or
not.
It
was
premature
work
that
did
not
make
excuses
without
asking
the
reason.
In
reality
Emilia
would
have
had
a
lot
of
things
he
wanted
to
talk
to
Julius.
--Im
sure
<@203488399061942272>
would
have
told
me
what
I
had
to
do.
So
Id
like
you
to
take
a
good
rest
now
and
postpone
the
rest
of
the
story.
...Oh
I
agree.
Basically
I
totally
surrender
to
Emilias
opinion
and
I
think
there
is
no
room
for
refusal
this
time
so
I
agree.
Sleep.
At
the
entrance
to
the
green
room
<@203488399061942272>
shrugged
to
Julius
who
was
seated
on
the
vine
bed.
Emilia
with
her
hand
on
her
hip
next
to
<@203488399061942272>
is
also
snorting.
Such
a
figure
is
also
cute.
In
response
to
these
two
words
Julius
sighs
while
touching
her
bangs.
Of
course.
Youre
too
annoying
to
you
and
Emilia.
You
cant
do
shameless
deeds
against
this
term
over
this
period.
You
can
obey
obediently.
One
word
that
I
understand
is
good
and
long...
Thats
true!
Apart
from
that
we
somehow
manage
to
do
that.
Its
Julius
whos
hurt
so
Ill
tell
you
Ill
have
to
rest
until
its
healed.
What?
「――――」
Paulash
please
ask
for
Julius.
If
anything
goes
wrong
call
out
loud
and
call
us.
With
Julias
eccentric
gratitude
cut
off
Emily
called
out
to
Patrashe
who
healed
the
injury
in
the
back
of
the
room-a
green
room
leaving
him
confused.
There
are
three
people
left
in
the
green
room
and
one
person-the
unconscious
Rem
and
Anastasia
have
injured
Julius
and
Patrasche.
There
is
a
limit
to
the
number
of
people
who
can
accept
a
green
room
at
one
time
so
<@203488399061942272>
and
Emilia
cannot
stay
behind
the
scenes.
Therefore
it
is
a
good
choice
for
someone
to
be
treated
inside
to
look
around.
Originally
that
role
should
be
left
to
Julius.
Its
meaningless
if
Emilia-sama
tells
you
so
much.
Lets
be
quiet
and
hanging
here.
The
lost
trust
is
hard
to
regain.
There
is
no
one
who
can
always
catch
up
with
the
high-scoring
Patrasche
in
the
field
of
trust.
If
something
happens
I
can
bite
it
without
mercy
Patrache.
「――――」
Stomaching
Patrasche
accepted
<@203488399061942272>s
and
Emilias
request-probably
accepted.
Patrache
who
is
the
best
known
woman
in
the
Emilia
camp
has
a
feeling
that
he
is
responsible
for
letting
Julius
go
alone.
It
was
full
of
drowsiness
with
a
motivated
attitude
that
there
was
absolutely
no
next.
Look
at
it.
Patrasche
also
says
Next
time
I
will
never
let
the
boo
go.
For
some
reason
it
seems
strange
to
say
so
so
its
strange.
But
according
to
our
militias
domestic
politician
bilingual
I
think
it
fits
with
such
a
nuance.
Its
a
lady
so
the
ending
might
be
.
Occasionally
when
Otto
translates
it
in
The
Protection
of
Words
and
Spirits
I
am
often
amazed
at
the
size
of
Patrasches
vessels
and
his
nostalgia
for
<@203488399061942272>.
Nowadays
I
feel
that
my
heart
is
getting
closer
to
each
other
without
Otto.
When
I
actually
said
it
I
bought
the
disapproval
of
Patrasche
and
was
hit
by
the
tail
so
my
maiden
spirit
was
complicated.
Anyway
Ill
be
quiet
and
devoted
to
healing
wounds.
Its
a
luxury
to
be
surrounded
by
maidens
and
rest
comfortably.
To
tell
you
the
truth
all
the
girls
in
this
room
are
mine
except
Anastasia.
To
Julius
unabated
mouth
<@203488399061942272>
insisted
pointing
in
turn
to
Rem
and
Patrasche
of
the
bed
and
then
Emilia
next
to
him.
In
response
Emilia
inflates
her
cheeks
with
mu
I
havent
belonged
to
<@203488399061942272>
yet...
I
thought
but
because
Im
a
knight
isnt
<@203488399061942272>
mine?
Thats
a
really
embarrassing
evaluation!
Emilia
who
put
her
finger
on
her
lips
was
reluctant
to
hear
what
she
might
say
but
<@203488399061942272>
looked
again
at
Julius
who
was
leaving
her
room.
It
takes
time
to
cross
the
distress
pass.
But
at
least
make
sure
you
have
enough
room
to
put
your
feet
on
the
first
lap.
That
while
youre
resting
it
might
be
tempting
to
think
about
it
a
while
ago
and
hold
your
head
around
but
dont
forget
that
Patrasche
is
watching.
Dont
worry.
Dont
expose
that
ugliness--because
its
not
elegant.
...Isnt
it
right?
Fu
The
answer
was
that
they
were
good
and
<@203488399061942272>
relaxed
with
a
relief.
It
was
a
double
defeat
and
it
was
a
complete
loss
with
no
hands
or
feet.
It
must
have
been
an
intolerable
humiliation
and
a
sense
of
helplessness
in
Julius
but
somehow
he
seems
to
have
outgrown
its
first
wave.
I
didnt
want
Julius
alone
on
the
long
stairs.
If
it
helped
even
a
little
it
was
worth
learning
from
the
experience
of
shame
in
front
of
many
people
at
<@203488399061942272>.
--
Patrasche
I
asked.
At
the
end
of
the
last
minute
<@203488399061942272>
and
Emilia
leave
the
green
room
pressing
in
love
with
the
dragon.
On
the
way
out
Patrasche
leaned
toward
Julius
and
the
surveillance
system
showed
that
Julius
was
smiling.
As
expected
Patrasche
is
a
wise
dragon
faithful
to
the
instructions.
For
Juliuss
state
of
mind
and
Patraches
loyal
dragon
it
would
be
okay
to
worry
about
the
personnel
left
in
the
green
room.
...Do
you
want
to
freeze
the
door
and
lock
it
in?
Im
just
surprised
by
Emilia
Tans
infinite
creativity
but
I
want
to
make
it
a
last
resort.
And
Im
not
scared
to
offend
the
spirit
of
the
green
room.
Yes
thats
right.
Fufu
I
just
told
you.
Im
kidding.
Emilia
gives
her
cute
tongue
out
and
apologizes
for
the
joke.
Leaving
his
reaction
to
his
lips
<@203488399061942272>
didnt
say
what
he
had
in
his
chest
as
another
option.
――In
the
worst
case
you
also
considered
a
means
to
seriously
shut
down
your
actions.
In
that
case
the
best
person
to
stop
Julius
is
Emilia
both
in
terms
of
ability
and
position.
Fortunately
Juliuss
state
of
mind
has
helped
him
stabilize
so
Im
glad
I
didnt
take
such
an
urgent
option.
<@203488399061942272>
is
also
relieved.
Anyway
lets
leave
the
green
room
to
the
spirit
of
the
person
in
charge
of
the
room.
It
looks
like
Patraches
wounds
have
healed
nicely
and
Julius
seems
to
be
like
that.
Yeah
yes.
Juliuss
wounds
arent
as
bad...
...Isnt
it
easy?
I
cant
tell
Julius.
<@203488399061942272>
scratches
his
head
and
agrees
with
Emilias
choice
of
words.
The
fact
that
the
obtained
item
is
a
stick
stick
is
only
the
ultimate
of
prank
but
the
fighting
power
of
the
raid
is
outstanding
so
that
the
powerful
person
like
Julius
is
treated
as
a
baby.
The
first
Kensei
a
hero
who
cooperated
with
wise
men
and
dragons
and
defeated
Jealous
witch.
It
is
a
different
story
whether
his
humanity
is
appropriate
for
being
revered
as
a
legendary
hero.
For
the
time
being
our
discussion
is...
--By
the
time
the
wound
of
Knight
Julius
is
healed
I
must
find
a
way
to
break
through
the
second
test?
「――――」
A
cold
voice
interrupted
the
conversation
between
<@203488399061942272>
and
Emilia.
If
you
look
at
it
its
a
rum
who
put
his
back
against
the
wall
of
the
aisle
and
was
waiting
for
them
to
come
back.
Lam
was
caught
waiting
in
the
aisle
due
to
the
limited
number
of
people
in
the
green
room.
<@203488399061942272>
who
was
hit
by
her
inner
heart
touched
her
cheek
with
a
dash.
My
face
is
so
diverse
that
you
can
get
inside
in
such
detail.
I
just
put
all
my
worries
on
my
face
all
at
once.
Now
Barus
has
only
one
person
or
reason
to
worry
about
in
his
room.
Thats
it.
Its
not
that
kind
of
thing.
Its
not
limited
to
this
all
the
people
with
me
are
worried.
Not
only
Emilia
Tan
and
Bearko
but
also
my
sister.
Huh!
In
response
to
<@203488399061942272>s
thumb-up
Ram
snorts
and
makes
a
fool.
Then
<@203488399061942272>
had
his
lips
pointed
at
the
rum
that
he
walked
with
his
back
turned
and
when
Emilia
next
to
him
snuggled
he
laughed
putting
his
hand
on
his
mouth.
Its
okay.
Lamb
is
just
a
little
shy.
Its
not
obedient.
Thats
because
my
desire
is
too
strong
but
if
Emilia-tan
says
so
then.
With
a
thin
smile
on
Emilias
side
<@203488399061942272>
rings
the
bones
in
her
neck
before
chasing
behind
Ram.
Lamb
headed
to
one
of
the
four
small
rooms.
When
you
step
into
the
room
...I
wonder
if
its
too
late.
Youre
waiting
too
long.
Do
you
think
Julius
is
okay?
The
welcoming
voice
is
Beatrice
who
was
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
room.
As
she
looked
up
at
<@203488399061942272>
and
Emilia
with
her
own
eyes
she
worried
about
Julius
making
a
subtle
expression.
I
laughed
at
his
obedient
attitude.
Dont
worry.
For
the
time
being
it
seems
that
the
pass
has
passed.
Im
afraid
that
I
have
a
sense
of
responsibility
so
Im
worried
about
that...
But
I
shouldnt
abandon
myself
anymore.
If
<@203488399061942272>
says
so
then
its
okay
to
believe
so
and
then
its
okay
because
the
problem
can
be
narrowed
down
to
one.
Beatrice
pulls
his
chin
after
receiving
the
confirmation
of
Juliuss
safety.
When
<@203488399061942272>
nodded
at
Beatrices
remark
he
looked
around
the
room.
The
small
room
is
one
of
the
many
empty
spaces
on
the
4th
floor
and
is
the
place
where
the
luggage
of
the
<@203488399061942272>
and
other
watch
tower
capture
groups
are
placed.
<@203488399061942272>
and
Emilia
and
Ram
and
Beatrice
face
each
other
in
a
cab
seat
in
that
room.
later--
I
want
to
tell
you
more
about
that
guy
Shaura.
Uhi
sir
youre
too
big!
But
I
dont
hate
being
strict
like
that.
I
hate
or
hate
it.
Thats
right
Master.
Odd.
Wet
clothes!
Its
Shaura
who
clings
to
Maily
who
holds
her
feminine
body
and
wriggles.
Lamb
rides
on
her
mad
behavior
but
its
also
a
good
false
charge
for
<@203488399061942272>.
Anyway
“First
of
all
everyone
was
grateful
for
the
search
for
Julius.
Even
if
I
told
him
to
stop
I
think
he
will
have
an
apology
after
all
but
its
safe
for
the
time
being.”
Its
okay.
I
told
Julius
himself
but
Im
glad
it
was
found
safely.
I
guess
everyone
is
too.
Its
a
problem
to
be
with
Emilia.
What?!
What?
<@203488399061942272>
tried
to
take
the
lead
of
the
whole
and
proceed
with
the
story
but
as
soon
as
there
was
a
disturbance
of
intention
between
Emilia
and
Ram.
When
Emilia
was
surprised
Lamb
pointed
one
finger
Are
you
sure?
As
far
as
I
hear
from
the
report
the
second
test
needs
to
be
overtaken
by
everyone
who
came
to
the
tower.
However
the
knight
Julius
is
willing
to
take
the
second
challenge
...
If
this
is
a
mistake
it
will
be
with
Anastasias
camp.
Its
an
action
that
can
crack
the
relationship.
Because
Julius
alone
could
have
failed
the
challenge
of
everyone?
If
that
were
the
case
all
the
journey
up
to
this
point
would
be
useless.
I
doubt
that
the
examiner
in
the
second
layer
would
be
able
to
return
me
safely...
including
the
wise
man
there.
For
a
moment
Rams
line
of
sight
explained
to
Emilia
turned
to
Shaula.
Perhaps
she
didnt
think
she
was
going
to
hit
her
Shaura
points
to
herself
Ah?
Is
the
wise
man
the
sword
of
ashi?
Thats
what
I
call
sage!
The
wise
man
doesnt
mean
that
ashi
is
himself!
sushi
is
named
by
the
teacher.
Its
only
Shouura
who
gave
me!
Obvious
Dont
look
at
me
and
say
that...
I
dont
mean
youre
wrong.
Although
a
little
overkill
Lams
guess
is
not
wrong
in
the
worst
case.
Juliuss
actions
endangered
the
entire
<@203488399061942272>s.
Considering
that
he
did
not
have
a
firm
grasp
of
the
outline
of
the
second
examination
it
could
be
said
that
he
was
indiscriminate
because
it
did.
Rum
doesnt
know
too
much
about
him
not
to
be
like
Julius.
I
thought
he
wouldnt
do
anything
like
that
including
eating.
Well
I
agree
but
I
dont
know
because
I
have
a
different
idea.
It
looks
like
a
mans
measles.
Measles?
Its
okay
with
chicken
pox.
「――――」
Either
way
I
put
in
nuances
like
illness
that
everyone
experiences
once.
It
would
be
light
to
say
that
this
time
Juliuss
dogma
falls
into
that
category
but
measles
and
chicken
pox
will
be
seriously
harmed
if
they
become
adults.
Especially
when
its
a
deadly
scene
to
expose.
It
didnt
become
fatal....
this
time
its
fine.
--Rum
just
doesnt
want
to
be
cut
off
by
others.
Taking
a
look
from
<@203488399061942272>
Ram
murmured
in
a
small
voice
like
that.
A
lamb
with
a
slightly
hardened
cheek.
<@203488399061942272>
raises
her
eyebrows
to
her.
My
sister
my
sisters
sister
I
havent
been
feeling
well
since
I
went
to
the
tower.
I
wonder
if
Im
tired
of
a
long
journey
or
maybe
the
horn
therapy
isnt
working.
Or
theres
something
else
to
worry
about...
maybe
thats
it.
Sit
next
door
and
chat
with
Beatrice
who
holds
hands
with
<@203488399061942272>.
Juliuss
arbitrariness
and
the
ram
that
hits
<@203488399061942272>
and
Shaura
with
invisible
irritability
its
an
attitude
thats
too
normal
for
her.
Perhaps
the
cause
is
the
frustration
of
being
out
of
reach
while
trying
to
rescue
REM.
Of
course
Beatrices
pointed
out
fatigue
and
scratches
on
the
corners
are
not
related
to
them.
Physical
and
mental
health
is
not
perfect.
Thats
what
caused
Lamb
to
lose
his
usual
composure.
So
do
you
just
want
to
fight?
Or
do
you
want
to
talk?
If
you
dont
decide
which
one
I
cant
even
get
along.
For
a
moment
it
was
Mary
who
waited
in
the
air
of
the
place
that
was
about
to
get
worse.
She
snuggled
next
to
Shaura
and
tampered
with
her
braid.
If
you
can
dont
stop
fighting.
I
hate
hurt
or
scared.
Youre...
no
its
a
fair
argument.
Dont
let
the
bystander
position
help.
Oh?
Ufufufu
then
thank
you.
Thanks
to
<@203488399061942272>
Mary
is
innocently
smiling
like
a
young
girl.
However
the
smile
was
somewhat
fascinating
and
hinted
at
her
dangerous
nature.
With
such
a
smile
on
his
face
<@203488399061942272>
holds
the
words
of
gratitude
in
his
words.
Looking
back
the
withdrawal
from
the
previous
examination
is
also
thanks
to
Marys
statement.
In
some
cases
it
was
her
contribution
a
companion
and
a
step
back
who
escaped
a
potentially
dangerous
predicament.
Ill
keep
asking
you
in
the
future.
Its
important
to
keep
calm
eyes.
Im
in
good
shape.
Even
if
I
say
that
my
job
is
over
when
I
leave
the
sandy
sea.
You
cant
do
anything
else.
But
I
dont
know.
Its
better
to
have
at
least
one
thinking
head
and
Im
a
lone
student
in
the
tower
including
being
able
to
survive
in
the
sandy
sea.
Thinking
that
I
was
unlucky
rely
on
me.
「――――」
Mailly
is
often
taken
aback
by
the
imposing
declaration
of
<@203488399061942272>.
Then
she
sighs
for
a
long
time
I
understand
why
Petra-chan
isnt
resting.
-What
happened
to
Petra?
Anything.
Instead
you
want
to
talk
to
your
naked
sister
right?
With
her
face
turned
away
Mary
who
stood
up
squeezed
Shauras
back.
Perhaps
he
wasnt
defeated
by
his
thin
arms
but
when
Shaura
stepped
forward
he
sat
down
with
his
knees
in
front
of
<@203488399061942272>s
eyes
and
bowed
to
his
place.
Sss
who
are
unlucky
but
for
the
long
term
thank
you
Dont
be
so
grateful.
So
what
I
want
to
ask
for
as
a
punishment
is...
it
hurts
it
hurts
it
hurts!
Emilia-tan!?
Bearko!?
Apart
Nothing
at
all
Im
dying
to
be
pinched
aside
for
nothing
but
the
attitudes
of
Emilia
and
Beatrice
were
hesitant
to
pursue
further.
Anyway
<@203488399061942272>
puts
his
throat
into
his
mouth
and
turns
to
Shaula
again.
It
was
definitely
Raid
Astrea
who
was
above.
I
admitted
it
so
I
want
to
hear
from
you
a
living
witness
from
that
time.
What
kind
of
guy
is
that?
It
was
a
human
waste
I
heard
that
before
and
in
fact
I
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes.
Shaura
who
bends
her
lips
and
misses
the
deceased
with
a
face
that
a
beautiful
girl
should
not
do.
Aside
from
the
fact
that
the
deceased
is
on
the
upper
floor
of
the
same
building
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
is
not
a
good
memory.
Of
course
as
soon
as
you
look
at
your
face
you
blow
bubbles
and
faint.
We
just
have
to
break
through
him.
We
want
to
get
one
more
tip
to
get
past
the
two-tiered
test.
Everything
you
can
think
of
please
tell
me
anything.
The
character
habits
relationships
likes
and
dislikes
weaknesses
of
the
Kensei
raid.
Well
I
want
to
hear
the
weaknesses.
Speak.
Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
However
you
knew
your
weaknesses
I
was
rushing
and
retried!
You
cant
use
it.
Isnt
it
better
than
your
teacher
this
girl...
Perhaps
there
is
a
pride
called
the
wise
man
Shaura
sharpens
her
lips
due
to
the
high-pressure
attitude
of
Lamb
from
above.
However
he
shrugged
his
neck
at
a
glance
at
the
ram
and
after
every
lap
he
went
around
behind
<@203488399061942272>
and
became
a
shield.
Why
do
you
hide?
Absolutely
you
are
stronger.
It
doesnt
matter
if
youre
strong
or
weak.
Somehow
your
instinct
makes
you
react
like
this.
Maybe
because
the
teacher
is
scared.
That
chatter
is
a
whole
body
with
the
teacher.
Its
being
transmitted
to
the
earth.
Dont
blame
me
for
your
chatter
Resting
on
the
soft
touch
of
his
back
<@203488399061942272>
grabbed
Shaulas
neck
and
forced
her
to
dislike
her.
Then
the
question
and
answer
session
will
resume
Um...
after
all
Shaura
knows
nothing
about
the
test
right?
Its
not
that
I
dont
know.
But
its
not
the
time
to
talk
about
it
now.
Probably
all
the
answers
will
be
revealed
when
the
mystery
of
the
tower
is
solved.
Thats
right...its
very
exciting.
Dont
fool
naive
Emilia-tan
Even
if
you
dont
understand
the
weaknesses
of
Kensei
do
you
have
a
habit?
If
you
have
a
habit
when
fighting
you
may
find
a
breakthrough.
Isnt
that
a
habit?
Speaking
of
which
when
I
was
trying
to
get
rid
of
Raids
sexual
harassment
he
was
fighting
while
scratching
his
own
butt!
Isnt
this
a
habit?
Thats
just
something...
In
the
first
place
the
conditions
for
breaking
the
test
are
ambiguous.
There
is
no
doubt
that
Emilia
was
approved
but
there
are
other
conditions...
There
must
be
something
to
recognize.
Maybe
Im
weak
for
beauty.
I
guess
Im
a
beauty.
In
that
case
isnt
it
just
me
and
Julius
left
behind...its
a
bad
situation.
Sure
depending
on
what
<@203488399061942272>
sees
if
I
do
my
best
if
I
close
the
eyes
of
that
man
I
can
be
sure
that
I
might
be
able
to
pass...!
You
are
cute
<@203488399061942272>
manages
to
hug
Beatrice
who
has
hurt
<@203488399061942272>
and
pats
his
head
while
answering
questions
that
are
of
little
use.
Beatrice
is
being
subdued
in
<@203488399061942272>s
arm
Either
way
its
a
coincidence
that
Emilia
was
recognized.
I
wonder
if
he
was
hit
because
he
was
alert
and
Emilias
attack.
What
is
that
heart?
If
Emilia
had
hit
me
to
kill
I
wouldnt
have
hit
him.
So
I
wonder
if
hes
off
guard
and
Emilias
victory.
That?
Am
I
praised
now?
I
praised
you.
Oh
after
all.
Thank
you
Fufu.
Im
so
happy.
Emilia
is
pleased
with
Beatrices
guess
and
the
compliments
derived
from
it
and
further
strokes
Beatrice
being
struck
by
<@203488399061942272>.
The
situation
is
quite
messy
but
its
a
scene
that
can
be
said
to
be
smiling.
But
its
cool
to
make
a
letter
that
responds
differently
depending
on
whether
or
not
there
is
a
murderous
intention
but
its
because
there
is
a
real
thing.
How
serious
is
it?
...You
should
reverse
the
idea.
As
Bars
says
he
doesnt
know
how
serious
he
is
but
he
shouldnt
be
serious.
Isnt
it
really
important?
After
picking
up
a
mumble
<@203488399061942272>
brows
over
Rams
thoughtful
spill.
Lamb
continued
to
think
Yes
to
the
words
The
reason
why
Emilia
was
approved
by
the
examiner
was
that
he
pulled
out
the
concessions
of
the
other
party
and
met
the
conditions
on
that
basis....
I
agree
with
the
fuzzy
conditions.
It
reflects
the
temper
of
the
examiner.
So
I
am
entertaining
the
examiner
and
presenting
the
conditions
for
the
test
to
pass.
On
top
of
that
defeating
the
examiner
is
the
condition
to
break
through
the
two
layers.
「――――」
Receiving
Rams
words
<@203488399061942272>
did
his
best
to
move
inside.
Emilias
condition
was
If
I
could
move
even
one
step
and
I
took
advantage
of
the
huge
amount
of
effort
and
a
little
fortune
to
win
the
victory-the
victory
at
the
most
lenient
stage
including
the
alert
of
the
raid.
We
should
consider
that
victory
with
armed
force
is
no
longer
possible.
I
dont
think
it
would
be
possible
to
win
rock-paper-scissors...
Find
the
conditions
that
convince
the
raid
and
do
my
best
with
it...
After
all
this
test
is
also
a
difficult
test
that
you
have
to
think
about.
Its
hard
work
and
I
think
this
is
a
nasty
test
in
a
sense
different
from
the
third
layer.
After
testing
your
intellect
knowledge
that
is
not
in
this
world
you
might
think
that
you
will
now
try
your
armed
force
worlds
strongest
level.
In
other
words
the
two-layered
test
is
different
from
the
three-layered
one
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
wise
man
who
built
the
observation
tower
exerted
the
naivety.
later--
-Isnt
that
good?
If
you
didnt
rush
so
much
you
could
do
it
slowly
Slowly
dont
forget
Shyura
who
shook
his
body
from
side
to
side
in
a
crossed
posture
looked
at
him
in
a
comfortable
tone.
In
response
<@203488399061942272>
frowns
but
she
doesnt
care
she
just
makes
her
eyes
shine
brightly
and
joyfully.
I
just
want
my
teachers
to
be
there
for
a
long
time.
Ive
been
waiting
for
them
for
hundreds
of
years.
that
is……
Itd
be
nice
if
he
could
pass
the
examination
in
due
time
and
Im
watching
it
for
a
long
time.-Days
years
hundreds
of
years.
It
was
a
word
with
weight
that
could
not
be
joked
and
laughed

with
Ashi
here!
――I
was
keenly
aware
of
the
smile
that
I
was
not
a
reliable
ally.
It
was
the
intense
heat
that
started
from
the
center
of
your
body
that
controlled
your
consciousness.
Guuuuuu!
Hot!
<@203488399061942272>
realizes
that
she
is
lying
prone
feeling
the
feel
of
a
solid
ground
on
her
face.
However
the
limbs
to
stand
up
do
not
move.
Physical
freedom
was
taken
away
as
if
I
was
not
myself.
However
it
was
not
a
joke
because
only
the
scorching
burns
<@203488399061942272>
endlessly.
--Hot
hot
hot
hot
hot
hot
hot
hot
hot.
If
you
open
your
mouth
a
lot
of
blood
spills
instead
of
a
scream.
After
suffering
from
pain
and
suffering
he
was
almost
drowning
in
his
own
overflowing
blood
and
<@203488399061942272>
was
able
to
enjoy
the
extreme
pain
of
this
world.
-What
on
earth
did
you
do?
The
desire
to
escape
from
suffering
makes
me
repeat
such
whining.
What
on
earth
did
I
do?
There
is
an
awareness
that
I
was
never
a
praiseworthy
way
of
life.
But
thats
not
limited
to
<@203488399061942272>.
No
one
should
have
lived
so
cleanly
that
everybody
could
be
proud
of
it.
You
must
have
something
you
want
to
back
regret
have
your
eyes
closed
and
have
compromised.
But
why
do
I
have
to
meet
this?
Why
is
it
the
only
fate
that
all
other
humans
spill?
Oh
shit...
A
murmur
leaked
from
the
gap
of
gurgling
and
overflowing
blood.
It
is
regret
hatred
for
helplessness
hatred
for
destiny
――It
was
a
frightening
feeling
for
you.
「――――」
Even
if
you
are
hurt
this
much
you
suffer
this
much
or
you
die.
Burning
and
burning
literally
slashing
in
sharp
pain
even
threatening
life.
The
image
of
a
girl
impressed
on
her
mind
is
all
smiles
and
sad
deaths.
I
Now
once
again
speak
of
determination.
Speak
preparedness.
Ill
regret
it
because
Im
sorry.
No

how
many
times
we
challenge
how
many
times
we
crawl
and
how
many
times
we
wish
we
will
seek
an
unreachable
future.
Pain
and
fever
are
all
far
away
and
the

dog
seems
to
be
a
losing
dog
and
barks
at
a
dash.

felt
strange
relief
and
weakness
when
he
saw
the
familiar
scene
again.
Its
safe
to
come
back
and
feel
safe.
Watching
the
comings
and
goings
of
the
royal
capital
<@203488399061942272>
wrote
regular
letters
on
the
ground

the

of
the

picked

until
he
was

Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>
is
an
ordinary

high
school
student
from
the

Earth
of
the
solar

No
one
would
be
skeptical
of
this
when
you
look
at
it
in
a
rough
look
wearing
a
jersey
sneakers
and
a
plastic
bag
from
a
convenience
store.
However
the
reason
is
applicable
only
to
cultural
areas
where
the
meaning
of
horizontal
letters
such
as
jerseys
sneakers
and
convenience
stores
can
be
properly
conveyed
and
values
u200bu200bcan
be
shared.
In
other
words
what
do
you
want
to
say?
-Isnt
the
summon
of
another
world
much
harder
than
I
expected?
A
lizard
that
was
as
large
as
a
horse
pulled
a
carriage
and
made
dust
and
ran
across
it.
Naturally
such
a
scene
cannot
be
seen
in
the
earth
sphere
known
to
<@203488399061942272>.
Then
when
it
is
said
that
it
is
a
cast
of
a
so-called
theme
park
where
horses
have
been
specially
made
it
is
not
easy
to
nod.
The
reason
is
that
not
only
one
lizard
but
also
everywhere
in
the
streets
and
towns
and
too
many
people
who
follow
the
lizard
received
special
makeup.
Humanoid
beasts-A
few
thirty
humans
dressed
as
races
such
as
beasts
and
subhumans
at
least
within
the
sight
of
<@203488399061942272>.
Of
course
there
are
many
general
park
visitors
who
look
the
same
as
<@203488399061942272>
but
they
are
buried
in
the
violence
of
their
appearance
and
they
do
not
come
into
their
consciousness.
In
the
first
place
I
cannot
dedicate
my
thoughts
to
such
an
escape.
Neither
beasts
lizards
nor
casts
nor
film
shoots.
This
is
a
cultural
sphere
where
this
is
commonplace
and
the
foreign
objects
here
are
not
<@203488399061942272>
but
<@203488399061942272>.
--Such
a
thing
is
painfully
felt
by
<@203488399061942272>
after
spending
more
than
a
dozen
days.
……Lets
go
He
discontinues
his
thoughts
without
profit
and
stands
up
by
paying
his
butt.
<@203488399061942272>
with
the
branch
of
the
tree
he
picked
up
in
his
right
hand
walked
into
the
street
with
a
vague
footsteps-not
to
be
confused
by
the
crowds
on
the
main
street
but
to
the
back
street.
Unlike
the
front
streets
crowded
with
people
the
back
streets
sandwiched
between
tall
buildings
are
not
very
popular.
The
place
which
was
dressed
exactly
like
the
back
alley
is
quiet
as
if
it
was
isolated
from
the
outside
world
just
by
separating
one
street.
To
tell
you
the
truth
no
matter
what
happens
here
screams
rarely
reach
the
surface.
Therefore
if
<@203488399061942272>
who
has
the
appearance
of
a
rising
man
slips
into
such
a
place
the
villain
who
looks
for
it
naturally
appears.
Yo
brother.
Lets
play
with
us
for
a
moment.
Turning
to
the
voices
that
were
cast
it
was
the
three
people
who
stood
to
block
the
street.
<@203488399061942272>
feels
their
serious
research
ability
with
a
lineup
of
large
medium
small
and
evenly-sized
products
that
meet
their
needs.
I
dont
know
what
kind
of
research
it
is.
「――――」
Tilt
your
head
and
look
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
triad.
Behind
this
alley
is
a
dead
end
and
the
only
way
to
get
to
the
main
street
is
to
go
through
a
trio.
And
if
the
trio
has
the
intention
to
bring
<@203488399061942272>
to
the
main
street
Hey
whats
wrong
with
you?
I
dont
know
the
situation.
I
should
teach
you.
The
slow-moving
<@203488399061942272>
moves
the
trio
to
make
a
ridiculous
grudge
with
a
humble
smile.
From
the
opponents
perspective
<@203488399061942272>
is
in
a
state
of
bare
amateur.
A
convenient
duck
I
cant
blame
you
for
licking
your
tongue
in
front
of
it.
But
its
completely
their
misnomer.
Certainly
<@203488399061942272>
has
never
had
a
proper
fight
and
has
no
hidden
history
of
learning
martial
arts.
Their
judgment
of
being
an
amateur
is
not
wrong.
However
if
he
only
has
experience
with
this
trio
<@203488399061942272>
is
already
battling
100
battles.
--Ah?
The
Giant
who
takes
care
of
himself:
He
named
the
three-man
as
Tonchinkan
and
thrusts
his
arm
toward
Ton.
The
arm
holds
the
tree
branch
that
was
picked
up
in
the
street
and
its
not
so
sharp
tip
digs
into
the
soft
part
of
the
throat
and
breaks
through
after
a
slight
resistance.
Hey?
At
that
moment
Tons
eyes
widened
and
Chin
and
Kang
who
stood
on
the
left
and
right
stiffened.
With
this
Ton
cannot
fight.
Then
of
the
two
stiff
people
he
reached
out
to
the
middle-medium-thin-backed
one—Chin
and
<@203488399061942272>
grabbed
his
hair
and
ears
and
swung
around.
I
wont
resist.
Give
momentum
and
hit
your
head
against
the
side
wall
at
a
stretch.
There
was
a
crushing
sound
of
a
hard
object
and
Chin
collapsed
marking
the
wall
with
blood.
At
the
same
time
Ton
with
a
tree
branch
stuck
in
his
neck
knees
down
and
falls
while
stripping
his
white
eyes.
How
to
fall
is
bad.
I
fell
down
in
front
of
me
so
the
branch
got
stuck
more
deeply.
Now
the
two
are
in
battle.
One
more
place
to
leave.
Hi
Petite
man-Kan
makes
his
face
pale
as
he
instantly
beats
two
of
his
friends.
If
as
they
were
they
abandoned
them
and
ran
outside
the
street
<@203488399061942272>
and
leg
strength
might
have
become
a
match
and
there
may
have
been
an
eye
to
survive.
Nevertheless
Kang
hesitated
to
run
away
looking
at
the
two
who
fell.
He
didnt
realize
it
was
too
late
so
he
abandoned
the
limited
one-second
delay.
Idiots.
Its
a
big
fool.
Get
the
reward
for
making
such
a
silly
choice.
Gu
but...
With
his
hand
on
his
thin
neck
<@203488399061942272>
pressed
his
can
against
the
back
wall.
Raise
your
violent
petite
body
while
pressing
it
against
the
wall.
I
put
my
strength
in
my
hands
and
tightened
it
up.
Kang
who
is
lifted
until
his
eyes
are
at
the
same
height
as
<@203488399061942272>
strangles
his
eyes
and
his
sloppy
mouth
gasps
for
oxygen.
However
salvation
will
not
come
to
him
whose
airway
was
blocked
by
force
and
deprived
of
his
freedom.
Do
you
know
how
many
times
I
have
met
you
in
total?
Ku...
Its
88
times.
Its
a
happy
day
with
a
wide
spread.
Laugh.
Gradually
reddish-black
staring
at
the
face
that
shed
tears
and
saliva
<@203488399061942272>
said.
But
of
course
Kang
cant
afford
it.
Soon
after
<@203488399061942272>
threw
away
his
tired
body
where
he
lost
resistance
rather
than
spared.
Look
down
at
the
three
people
who
fall
down
and
for
the
time
being
step
on
their
necks
once
just
in
case.
If
the
heel
of
your
sneaker
feels
like
its
breaking
hard
youre
safe.
Only
the
tons
neck
was
thick
and
it
was
necessary
to
carefully
traverse
it
five
times.
No
matter
how
many
times
I
do
this
I
cant
get
the
hang
of
it.
Luckily
sometimes
its
possible
to
get
rid
of
each
one.
Its
not
smart
to
squeeze
your
neck.
It
feels
bad
so
lets
stop.
Based
on
such
reflections
<@203488399061942272>
borrows
two
knives
from
Chins
body.
Then
the
three
corpses
were
properly
brought
to
the
side
of
the
road
and
left
the
back
alley
as
if
nothing
had
happened.
When
I
entered
the
alley
and
met
with
Tonchinkan
things
happened
quite
early.
It
took
me
a
while
to
process
the
tontincan
but
it
took
only
a
dozen
seconds.
<@203488399061942272>
hurriedly
passed
the
main
street
and
proceeded
to
the
desired
location.
「――――」
Looking
at
the
street
I
stroked
my
chest
comfortably
when
I
was
in
time.
On
the
main
street
called
the
commercial
district
the
same
human
waves
as
those
on
the
other
side
are
disturbing
on
the
left
and
right
and
it
has
a
role
to
prove
the
liveliness
of
the
Royal
Capital
of
Lugnica.
Its
a
space
where
even
if
you
just
stand
up
theres
more
than
enough
noise
to
jump
into
your
eardrum.
However
the
lively
atmosphere
suddenly
changes
to
a
different
shape.
-Wait!
Already!
Wait!
On
the
other
hand
it
was
the
audible
sound
of
the
silver
bells
that
struck
the
high
streets.
While
confined
to
a
savage
atmosphere
somewhere
in
the
voice
of
the
voice
of
the
Lord
who
cant
hide
the
calmness
of
his
temper
is
directed
towards
the
petite
shadow
that
slips
through
the
crowd
of
people
on
the
street.
Heheh
A
blonde
girl
spills
a
cat-like
smile
and
sewes
through
the
gaps
between
people.
Something
shining
in
his
hand
is
grasped
and
it
seems
that
there
is
a
sense
of
having
finished
one
work.
Then
I
aimed
at
the
girl
and
broke
the
street
with
a
pale
radiance-an
ice
spear
jumped.
--!
A
girl
was
surprised
by
an
unexpected
attack
and
used
her
jumping
and
bouncing
to
shed
the
ice
spear.
The
magical
attack
was
released
on
a
crowded
street
and
suddenly
there
was
confusion
and
the
people
of
the
royal
capital
opened
their
way
all
together
raising
both
hands
saying
that
it
was
impermissible
to
get
involved.
Its
a
very
well-coordinated
movement.
Its
not
a
matter
of
everyday
things
that
get
involved
in
the
turmoil
in
the
royal
capital
but
there
may
be
something
close
to
that.
Anyway
it
is
the
person
you
are
looking
for
who
runs
through
the
open
road
and
shows
you.
「――――」
The
moment
she
sees
her
<@203488399061942272>
feels
like
the
whole
world
is
frozen.
The
wind
the
voice
of
the
person
and
even
the
time
are
no
longer
felt
and
everything
in
consciousness
is
taken
away
by
the
body.
Makes
long
silver
hair
dance
and
makes
the
jewel-like
purplish
blue
eyes
shine
strongly.
Mysterious
white
costumes
that
were
tailor-made
for
the
fairy
on
white
and
long
limbs.
In
a
world
where
time
has
stopped
only
she
escapes
the
stillness
of
time
and
passes
by
in
front
of
<@203488399061942272>.
Her
purpose
is
a
blonde
girl
who
just
slipped
through-felt.
Something
was
taken
by
the
felt
and
she
fled
the
royal
capital
to
recover
it.
And
that
is
her
path
to
an
unavoidable
destiny.
But
I
wont
let
you
do
that.
Never
let
her
be
destined
for
death.
I
will
definitely
save
you
On
her
back
away
<@203488399061942272>
makes
an
88th
oath.
I
dont
know
how
persuasive
a
vow
that
keeps
breaking
like
this
is.
I
dont
know
but
if
you
dont
give
up
if
you
keep
fighting
if
you
keep
wanting
to
save--
Please
wait.--Satella
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
The
power
to
die
and
rewind
time
return
to
death.
This
is
the
88th
time
for
<@203488399061942272>
to
redo
the
world
with
this
return
to
death
power.
Already
the
challenge
is
about
to
reach
the
100th
stage
but
all
of
that
has
been
done
to
rescue
the
silver-haired
girl-Satella
from
the
dead
end
by
destiny.
I
tried
this
with
a
lot
of
trial
and
error
but
it
doesnt
look
like
Tonchinkan.
And
thats
<@203488399061942272>s
conclusion
to
this
fates
greatest
enemy-Erza
Granhilte.
Satella
asked
Felt
to
steal
the
stolen
item
the
emblem
by
the
jet-black
woman
named
Elsa.
This
woman
is
a
dangerous
person
who
kills
Satella
many
times.
So
far
<@203488399061942272>
has
repeatedly
struggled
to
eliminate
Elsa
and
ensure
the
safety
of
Satella
in
the
eighty-seven
challenges.
He
was
defeated
and
lost
his
life
with
his
stomach
open
more
than
50
times.
Elsa
a
sadist
who
loves
to
be
hungry
isnt
the
one
who
can
fight
and
win.
If
this
is
a
person
like
Tonchinkan
it
is
possible
to
pattern
some
actions
and
devise
a
winning
strategy.
However
when
it
comes
to
being
as
strong
as
Elsa
its
not
strange
that
<@203488399061942272>
was
decapitated
as
soon
as
he
tried
to
take
action.
In
fact
Ive
been
torn
many
times
with
the
blink
of
an
eye
not
the
neck.
<@203488399061942272>
cannot
fight
and
win.
The
same
applies
to
felt
rom
grandpa
and
satera.
After
receiving
that
conclusion
the
tactic
that
<@203488399061942272>
chose
was--
Lovely!
Nice!
I
wish
I
could
entertain
you
more!
Gua---!
Black
blades
flutter
one
after
another
and
blood
gushes
every
time
the
wind
winds.
The
number
of
people
who
had
fallen
down
the
street
was
already
too
high
with
the
fingers
of
both
hands
and
the
expression
of
Elsa
who
was
returning
blood
passed
through
the
ecstasy
and
seemed
to
even
experience
intermittent
climax.
Even
in
such
a
terrible
situation
Elsa
is
getting
more
and
more
scented
as
she
is
bathed
in
blood.
There
used
to
be
an
anecdote
that
a
woman
who
tried
to
keep
her
youth
by
taking
the
blood
of
a
virgin
in
the
past
was
called
a
vampire
but
now
Elsa
looks
exactly
like
that
vampire.
...This
also
failed?
Sighing
<@203488399061942272>
lurking
on
the
roof
squinted
while
overlooking
the
tragedy.
The
place
is
a
corner
of
a
slum
a
particularly
lonely
section
surrounded
by
ruins
and
in
the
kind
of
plaza-like
space
the
bloods
misery
has
been
expanding.
It
is
the
guards
of
the
royal
city
that
cross
Elsa
and
the
sword
and
all
of
them
fall
deadly.
People
who
received
a
report
from
a
citizen
of
good
faith
and
found
a
dangerous
person
Elsa
Granhilte
who
challenged
their
capture
and
dispersed
their
lives:
It
was
a
sight
that
was
heart-breaking
as
a
citizen
of
good
faith.
No
way
there
seems
to
be
a
difference
in
ability
between
ordinary
guards
and
Elsa...
Its
like
offering
a
sacrifice
to
please
Elsa.
<@203488399061942272>s
expectation
was
that
a
person
in
the
position
of
a
guard
guarding
the
royal
city
could
strengthen
his
body
with
some
sort
of
magical
force
and
evenly
compete
with
Elsa
but
it
seems
to
be
a
high
hope.
It
seems
that
there
was
nothing
else.
After
all
the
power
of
Elsa
is
in
an
outstanding
area
in
this
world.
Increasingly
resentful
towards
Elsa.
However
no
matter
how
intensely
angry
he
is
the
power
of
<@203488399061942272>
will
not
stop
him.
I
couldnt
even
think
Elsa
was
killed
with
the
lucky
punches
of
the
guards.
Is
it
useless
to
see
more?
Its
bad
for
the
victims
but
Ill
end
this
attempt
here.
Im
not
going
to
give
up
yet
but
those
who
died
here
will
come
back
to
life
in
a
redone
world
if
<@203488399061942272>
finally
fails
and
dies.
As
a
sacrifice
for
that
lets
have
tears
die
for
now.
If
they
have
the
next
opportunity
they
dont
expect
anything
so
I
want
them
to
feel
at
ease
and
protect
the
peace
of
the
royal
capital.
Yes
it
was
when
<@203488399061942272>
came
to
the
conclusion
and
tried
to
leave.
--Oh
He
stopped
and
Elsa
struck
her
bloody
lips
with
her
tongue
raising
her
sword.
Overflowing
madness
and
murderousness
are
the
proof
that
Elsa
who
is
tired
of
the
game
of
slaughtering
the
guards
has
found
a
new
prey.
And
the
poor
sacrifice
of
Elsa
was...
--Its
that
far
<@203488399061942272>
illusions
that
a
red
flame
is
standing
there.
「――――」
I
took
a
breath
shook
my
eyes
and
after
a
second
review
I
could
admit
that
it
was
a
person
not
a
flame.
It
is
a
young
man
with
red
flame
hair
and
blue
eyes
that
traps
the
clear
sky.
Although
it
looks
slender
it
is
wrapped
in
a
lithely
trained
tall
body
in
a
white
outfit
and
carries
a
sword
with
a
horrifyingly
high
back.
If
there
are
100
people
100
of
them
will
look
back
and
the
features
of
God
are
so
beautiful
that
they
will
be
fascinating.
The
violence
of
beauty
that
transcends
gender
and
the
reason
why
you
dont
feel
it
is
the
gentle
appearance
of
the
youth.
At
a
glance
the
presence
that
makes
you
know
in
the
soul
that
you
are
different
from
the
imaginary
and
invisible.
Knight
Reinhardt...!
You
guys
are
going
down.
Shes...gut
hunting.
There
are
already
too
many
victims.
I
dont
want
to
give
any
more.
To
the
trembling
voice
of
the
surviving
guard
a
young
man-Reinhardt
said
with
his
eyes
closed.
It
was
a
pity
for
a
life
that
was
slaughtered
like
dust
and
a
righteousness
for
the
murderer
named
Elsa
who
did
it.
<@203488399061942272>
who
sees
it
at
a
distance
can
see
the
heart
of
a
young
man
named
Reinhardt.
A
man
who
gets
angry
with
a
proper
spirituality
for
a
proper
reason
under
a
proper
idea.
Sad
death
hated
slaughter
regret
not
reaching
repainting
regret
with
belief.
Thats
how
the
young
man
called
Reinhardt-the
knight
should
be.
Reinhard
van
Astrea.
Its
a
family
of
Kensei.
Its
wonderful!
Its
a
day
when
Im
overwhelmed
by
the
weight
of
excessive
evaluation.
Youll
definitely
be
bowel
hunting.
Yes
thats
right.
No.
What
should
I
do?
I
have
a
favorite
job
but
Ill
meet
you
in
a
place
like
this.
With
an
ecstatic
sigh
of
exhalation
Elsa
turns
her
hot
eyes
to
Reinhardt.
On
the
other
hand
Reinhardts
expression
is
serious
and
the
blue
twins
have
a
sense
of
mission
and
no
playfulness.
Although
they
face
each
other
with
opposite
thoughts
the
conclusions
drawn
by
their
hearts
are
the
same.
I
have
no
choice
but
to
kill
each
other
and
reach
the
goal.
Once
I
should
recommend
surrendering...
In
the
face
of
this
disaster
will
you
tell
me
that?
Its
kind.
Its
cruel
to
me
and
to
them.
-No
I
agree.
Its
not
sincere
to
their
death
that
you
add
your
attention
here
so
I
dont
want
you
to
surrender.
Reinhardt
shook
his
head
loosely
in
response
to
Elsas
words
which
happily
kicked
the
bodies
of
the
falling
guards.
Then
he
reaches
out
to
a
guard
who
stands
by
and
tells
him
briefly
Sword.
Please
please.
The
ordered
guards
held
out
his
sword
and
Reinhardt
grabbed
it
and
confirmed
the
feel.
Elsas
eyebrows
blushed
Why
dont
you
use
the
sword
on
your
waist?
Ive
heard
from
rumor
that
I
want
to
feel
the
sharpness
of
a
dragon
sword.
Unfortunately
this
sword
has
the
property
of
identifying
who
should
be
pulled
out.
Its
a
bit
awkward
but
the
sword
doesnt
seem
to
like
you.
Instead
lets
deal
with
it.
Fun
Elsa
exhales
to
Reinhard
holding
the
received
sword
instead
of
the
waist
sword.
However
the
disgruntled
attitude
was
a
moment.
Immediately
switched
the
woman
licked
her
tongue
in
battle
with
the
young
man
standing
in
front
of
her
and
the
premonition
of
blood.
And--
Gut-hunting
Elsa
Granhilte
The
Family
of
Kensei
Reinhard
Van
Astrea
The
two
fight
each
other
and
become
a
breeze
in
the
center
of
the
plaza.
The
game
was
settled
only
once.
An
insane
slash
which
creates
a
swirl
of
light
and
a
shock
wave
collapses
a
corner
of
slums.
The
mans
sword
attack
called
Kensei
was
exactly
power
itself.
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>
was
looking
at
the
scene
with
his
eyes
wide
open.
I
did
not
understand
the
tears
that
ran
down
my
cheeks
and
the
cause
of
the
trembling
knees.
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
Although
<@203488399061942272>
worked
differently
than
what
was
expected
and
expected
it
can
be
said
that
the
greatest
purpose
of
overthrowing
Elsa
was
fulfilled.
Reinhardts
entry
was
unexpected
but
if
the
wish
came
true
he
would
be
very
happy.
Thanks
to
that
the
events
surrounding
Satellas
emblem
are
resolved
successfully.
Felt
and
Rom
wouldnt
be
forced
to
secure
Satellas
emblem
unless
the
trading
partner
Elsa
joined.
It
is
unlikely
that
Satella
will
leave
her
angry
and
kill
them.
The
story
centered
around
the
stolen
warehouse
is
completed
with
the
minimum
required
characters.
That
was
a
desirable
result
for
<@203488399061942272>
as
well.
So--
--Why
do
you
help
me?
You
dont
have
to
trust
me.
If
youre
surrounded
by
guards
and
you
cant
revenge
you
can
throw
me
away
and
run
for
whatever
you
want.
「――――」
Spitting
back
<@203488399061942272>
told
Elsa
leaning
against
the
wall
leaning
behind
her.
The
whole
body
is
covered
in
blood
the
black
costume
is
broken
here
and
there
and
the
white
skin
is
exposed.
However
since
there
are
sore
scars
on
the
skin
there
is
no
room
for
shame.
In
the
first
place
<@203488399061942272>
has
no
interest
in
Elsa
as
a
woman.
But
Im
just
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunity
because
I
thought
I
could
use
it.
The
guards
are
looking
for
you
with
a
bloody
eye.
Ill
guide
you
in
the
wrong
direction
so
itll
take
you
a
while
longer
to
notice
me.
The
wound?
It
hurts
a
lot.
It
hurts
it
hurts
I
dont
think
Im
dead.
I
dont
know
its
a
sensibility.
I
cant
do
it
if
I
die
so
Ill
do
something
about
it.
At
best
he
is
taking
the
risk
of
leading
Elsa
to
survive.
If
I
fell
down
here
let
alone
<@203488399061942272>
and
the
incident
involved
in
the
search
for
the
guards
the
accidental
survival
route
of
Satella
becomes
a
bubble
of
water.
In
that
case
just
continue
rolling
the
dice
until
this
time
again.
Can
you
make
a
way
to
the
southeast
of
the
slums?
Then
I
can
join
my
sister.
Ill
be
ready
to
take
care
of
the
wounds
and
get
away.
My
sister!
Haha
I
cant
save
you
as
a
sister.
It
wasnt
trusted
and
even
if
it
was
trusted
there
was
a
spit
but
in
the
words
of
Elsa
<@203488399061942272>
took
steps
to
survive
this
difficult
situation.
It
has
already
flowed
quite
south
in
the
process
of
escaping.
From
here
it
does
not
take
you
to
the
place
Elsa
has
instructed.
Elizas
possession
of
holy
gold
coins
the
people
of
the
shanty
town
acquired
by
<@203488399061942272>
hinder
the
search
of
the
guards
and
guides
them
to
the
wrong
person.
No
problem.
You
dont
know
is
your
purpose
I
want
to
make
a
loan
to
you.
Someday
it
may
be
useful.
Lend
me.
Thats
strange.
-You
want
to
kill
me
so
much.
He
said
to
Elsa
lending
her
shoulders
and
helping
her
escape.
Elsas
black
eyes
look
up
at
<@203488399061942272>
immediately
and
try
to
look
into
the
emotions
behind
them.
However
there
is
no
need
to
look
into
the
back.
<@203488399061942272>s
black-eyed
answer
is
exactly
what
Elsa
picked
up.
<@203488399061942272>
wants
to
kill
Elsa
now
if
possible.
However
if
you
dont
think
about
it
<@203488399061942272>
cant
beat
even
the
dying
Elsa
and
its
a
short
circuit
in
the
first
place.
<@203488399061942272>
is
now
assuming
that
the
situation
in
which
he
is
placed
is
a
heavily
biased
game
board.
A
battle
based
on
the
premise
that
all
hands
are
considered
trial
and
error
and
the
best
move
is
taken.
If
you
think
of
this
as
something
like
shogi
its
not
easy
to
win
if
you
get
rid
of
the
pieces
on
the
board
randomly.
Swap
enemies
and
allies
if
possible.
If
there
is
a
gap
Im
willing
to
change
the
standing.
To
do
so
you
should
use
even
the
person
who
really
hated
you
to
kill.
I
want
to
kill
you.
Ill
kill
you
someday
but
not
now.
so
Needless
to
say
<@203488399061942272>
confided
his
bottom
to
Elsa.
If
Elsa
is
now
a
cautious
person
she
would
have
killed
<@203488399061942272>
here
in
order
to
cut
off
the
worries
of
her
followers.
But
<@203488399061942272>
was
convinced
it
wouldnt.
It
was
the
conviction
of
killing
that
only
<@203488399061942272>
who
had
been
killed
by
Elsa
eighty-eight
times
had
been
killed
more
than
eighty
times.
Lovely.
I
hate
you
and
me.
Im
sure.
Eventually.
Surely
your
words
will
prove
to
me.
Thats
very
very
nice.
「――――」
She
loosened
her
lips
which
were
soaked
in
blood
and
dyed
red
and
smiled
like
Elsas
maiden
in
love.
With
that
smile
close
at
hand
<@203488399061942272>
truly
thought
that
this
woman
was
horrifying.
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
Will
you
see
me
again?
Well
older
brother.
Im
grateful
for
Elsa.
Handing
over
Elsa
to
the
dark
blue-haired
girl
who
joined
<@203488399061942272>
exhaled.
Waiting
for
the
abandoned
house
Elsa
instructed
was
a
young
girl
in
her
early
teens.
At
first
<@203488399061942272>
was
surprised
at
the
young
age
but
the
girl
treated
Elsas
wounds
in
an
accustomed
manner
and
when
she
was
ready
to
escape
from
the
royal
capital
she
quickly
pulled
up
the
abandoned
house.
<@203488399061942272>
barely
secured
the
means
of
contact
with
Elsa.
Im
not
sure
if
the
reward
is
worth
the
risk
I
took.
It
depends
on
my
actions
from
now
on?
Taking
off
his
jacket
a
blood-stained
jersey
<@203488399061942272>
rolls
it
around
his
waist
and
begins
to
walk.
The
tip
of
your
foot
is
the
opposite
of
shanty
town
the
direction
of
stolen
goods.
At
that
place
where
Elsa
couldnt
go
I
was
wondering
if
Satella
could
safely
recover
her
emblem.
「――――」
<@203488399061942272>
takes
time
and
arrives
at
the
stolen
storehouse
and
his
eyes
open
to
the
scene.
This
was
unexpected.
In
front
of
the
spilled
<@203488399061942272>
is
a
scene
of
a
stolen
warehouse
that
has
been
frozen
in
ice.
It
is
more
correct
to
say
that
a
stolen
warehouse
is
trapped
in
ice
than
to
be
pickled.
When
I
asked
a
resident
near
me
what
happened
Grandpa
who
was
the
face
of
the
stolen
goods
and
his
granddaughter
were
drawn
to
the
guards.
Anyhow
I
couldnt
do
anything
about
turning
a
witch
into
an
enemy...
I
dont
want
to
be
involved.
Is
the
grandchild
and
grandfather
safe?
The
witch?
I
didnt
want
to
get
hurt
but
I
didnt
really
look
at
either.
Its
good.
Perhaps
the
creepy
momentum
of
<@203488399061942272>s
momentum
seemed
creepy
the
man
shook
off
<@203488399061942272>s
arm
and
rushed
away
in
the
darkness
of
the
back
alley
and
ran
away.
Looking
off
his
back
rumination
of
the
mans
words
<@203488399061942272>
pats
his
relief
on
his
chest.
I
dont
know
how
true
the
mans
words
are
but
at
least
you
shouldnt
confuse
the
story
of
the
dead
with
the
present.
It
is
unavoidable
that
Felt
and
Rom
were
caught
by
the
guards
because
the
livelihood
they
were
doing
was
a
livelihood.
You
should
eat
stinking
rice
for
a
while
and
reflect
on
your
business.
Then
I
know
that
Satella
safely
saved
<@203488399061942272>s
wishes.
-Well.
Now
what
do
I
do?
Scratching
his
head
<@203488399061942272>
realizes
that
his
purpose
is
empty.
Summoned
in
a
different
world
given
the
power
to
return
to
death
make
full
use
of
it
to
help
that
friendly
and
pretty
silver-haired
half-elf.
In
order
to
accomplish
that
he
died
87
times
and
arrived
here.
Oh
I
should
die
and
start
over
and
ask
why
Elsa
was
trying
to
steal
the
emblem
from
Satella...?
I
should
have
heard
it
while
carrying
the
injured
Elsa
but
I
forgot.
However
if
I
heard
that
I
went
into
Elsas
situation
there
and
found
that
<@203488399061942272>
was
emotionally
leaning
toward
Satella
I
dont
know
how
Elsa
acted.
As
a
result
now
<@203488399061942272>
and
Satella
have
life.
If
that
is
the
correct
answer.
If
possible
I
would
like
to
know
more
about
Satella...
I
dont
know
where
Satella
came
from
where
I
went
or
when
I
could
meet
again.
There
is
a
way
to
repeat
it
until
I
see
it.
If
there
is
any
other
means-
-Is
that
you
guys
can
tell
me?
<@203488399061942272>
looks
back
with
his
hands
in
his
pocket
in
front
of
the
frozen
storehouse.
There
is
no
sign
of
people.
However
I
could
see
countless
figures
standing
in
<@203488399061942272>s
field
of
view.
A
mediocre
group
of
men
and
women
of
all
ages
with
no
sense
of
unity.
If
there
is
only
one
united
person
in
the
group
it
is
the
twin.
Both
have
dead
eyes.
For
madness
for
madness
and
for
that.
Im
sure
<@203488399061942272>
should
have
the
same
eyes
in
the
mirror.
「――――」
The
sentiment
eased
his
cheeks
and
<@203488399061942272>
looked
up.
The
scary
clear
moon
was
silently
looking
down
at
the
frozen
stolen
warehouse
and
the
madman.
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
It
wasnt
until
nearly
two
months
after
that
that
Satellas
identity
was
revealed
in
detail.
King
election!
Half-elf
with
silver
hair!
Recommended
by
Roswar
L.
Mathers
Frontier!
Emilia
not
Satella!
Without
any
progress
<@203488399061942272>
slammed
his
hands
with
a
joyous
look
as
he
jumped
into
the
detailed
information
that
jumped
into
the
discontinued
part
of
the
follow-up
report.
Unexpectedly
the
information
flowed
in
was
the
news
of
the
Through
Selection
Battle
that
was
posted
not
only
in
the
royal
capital
but
throughout
the
country
in
response
to
the
official
announcement
from
the
royal
castle.
Primitively
<@203488399061942272>
who
made
a
fool
of
saying
that
at
most
one
countrys
election
was
ridiculed
by
the
information
that
was
originally
raised
by
standing
a
signboard
in
the
city.
Five
women
set
up
as
candidates-because
there
was
a
girl
who
was
looking
for
them.
King
election
king
election...
The
candidate
for
the
king
is
a
person
who
has
no
self-determination.
It
makes
sense
that
just
walking
was
full
of
dignity.
Emilia
Emilia?
By
knowing
his
real
name
<@203488399061942272>s
heart
becomes
lighter
as
if
it
had
wings.
At
first
I
knew
that
I
was
named
Satella
and
lied.
She-why
Emilia
gave
<@203488399061942272>
a
false
name
such
as
Satella
and
why.
Because
if
there
is
a
silver-haired
half-elf
calling
himself
Satella
Obviously
people
wouldnt
approach
because
of
doubts
about
their
involvement
with
them.
It
was
a
bit
of
a
trick
to
keep
me
away
from
danger.
Think
cute
things
with
a
cute
face.
He
lonely
talks
about
being
a
half
elf
and
while
keeping
his
face
afraid
of
being
distant
he
tries
to
use
it
in
consideration
of
the
other
person
and
keep
him
away
from
danger.
What
a
gentle
and
healthy
child!
I
think
my
chest
will
be
tightened.
There--
--Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>!
Beloved
followers!
Are
you
here
the
death!?
「――――」
A
harsh
harsh
bird-squeaking
voice
echoes
calling
for
<@203488399061942272>s
name.
Frowning
at
the
voice
<@203488399061942272>
put
the
standing
sign
that
had
been
torn
from
the
royal
city
on
the
bed
and
unwillingly
opened
the
door
and
went
outside
the
private
room.
Outside
the
room
there
is
cold
air
and
a
dark
space.
Not
only
the
harsh
voices
that
echo
in
the
space
but
also
the
unusually
squeaking
shoe
sounds.
Then
when
I
put
my
back
in
the
closed
door
and
waited
only
the
twilight
passed
through
the
passage
and
a
man
with
a
pale
unhealthy
face
appeared
vaguely.
When
the
man
saw
<@203488399061942272>
his
eyes
opened
and
he
opened
his
eyes
to
him.
The
Death
I
searched
for.
Why
why
and
why
Im
so
lazy
in
such
a
place!?
We
are
diligent!
Even
though
the
witchs
guidance
is
that
she
must
respond
to
love.
Iiiiii!
Dont
tell
me
Pete-san.
Im
just
following
the
Gospel
instructions.
The
Gospel
commanded
me
to
spend
here.
What!
The
Gospel
does
you
do
that!?
At
this
time
on
this
occasion
why
does
a
godly
believer
like
you
play
in
this
situation?
Or
I
can
even
guess
what
I
am!
Even
death!
She
shouts
loudly
and
not
only
that
but
also
her
movements
are
noisy.
In
the
face
of
the
very
madman-Petergeus
Romanée-Conti
<@203488399061942272>
was
struggling
to
endure
a
sigh.
Its
a
madman
who
doesnt
like
him
but
he
must
be
a
useful
opponent
for
<@203488399061942272>.
After
all
it
is
doubtful
that
<@203488399061942272>s
group
is
always
a
self-centered
group
of
ego
and
that
even
generalists
have
self-consciousness.
<@203488399061942272>
had
inferred
that
the
weakness
of
the
feelings
of
the
generalist
was
that
there
was
some
kind
of
interference
in
his/her
daily
life
to
prevent
his/her
belonging
from
being
exposed.
Anyway
such
consideration
does
not
matter.
What
is
important
is
the
purpose
of
this
visit
of
Petergius
who
is
in
a
position
with
authority
far
from
the
generalists.
For
the
past
two
months
<@203488399061942272>
has
been
welcomed
by
a
group
of
people
including
Petergeus
and
has
been
given
a
comfortable
life.
However
I
am
not
inconvenienced
in
my
life
but
in
terms
of
behavior
and
spirituality.
In
particular
having
many
opportunities
to
come
in
contact
with
madman
and
fanatics
was
nothing
but
pain
for
<@203488399061942272>
who
could
only
have
common
sense.
The
house
is
a
cave
with
a
hidden
entrance
in
the
mountains.
Surprisingly
it
has
excellent
habitability
and
is
treated
so
that
it
will
be
addressed
to
its
own
room
but
it
is
far
from
the
secluded
area
and
the
hardness
of
the
floor
and
the
warmth
of
the
walls
can
withstand
the
modern
<@203488399061942272>.
However
acting
isnt
good
enough
to
hide
the
relationship
with
them
in
the
outside
environment.
Living
here
as
a
compromise
and
accumulating
knowledge
of
this
world
was
useful.
And
whats
the
business
for
me
as
a
hermit?
Did
you
not
know
it?
A
stupid
event
that
is
about
to
take
place
in
this
country!
In
the
country
what
is
the
future...
is
it
a
king
election?
Yeah!
Death!
King
election!
Death
is
not
the
problem
there!
Death
is
not
the
king
election
itself
but
the
existence
that
participates
in
the
king
election!
「――――」
Probably
to
teach
<@203488399061942272>
who
was
not
aware
of
it
Petergius
brought
in
the
royal
election-bringing
the
same
thing
that
<@203488399061942272>
had
in
his
room.
Of
course
there
is
the
face
of
a
lovely
girl
staring
at
the
hole.
The
bone
and
skin
fingers
of
Petergius
also
pointed
at
the
girls
face.
The
Death
of
Seeing!
The
Style!
The
Origin!
Its
a
Desecration
of
a
Witch!
Were
the
ones
we
shouldnt
overlook!
This
is
a
time
of
trial!
ordeal
Yes
death!
Screaming
loudly
Petergius
presses
the
poster
on
the
rock
wall
of
the
cave.
Then
he
slammed
his
fist
against
Emilias
facebook
and
blood
splattered.
A
maniac
who
prefers
to
be
self-harm
blames
Emilia
on
paper
sick
of
pain
and
blood.
Hold
it
if
it
fits!
If
it
doesnt
fit
it
drain
it!
Make
sure
its
a
device
suitable
for
a
witch
and
if
it
fits
accept
it
under
us!
Death!
We
must
test
it!
Can
you
help
me
with
that?
Yeah
thats
right!
I
called
out
to
other
things
but
I
cant
believe
that
the
ungodly
ones
will
respond!
Death
was
the
only
possibility
of
anger
but
now
Is
far
from
the
kingdom...
so
we
must
go
alone!”
With
a
sense
of
mission
in
mind
Petergius
with
tears
and
tears
squeezes
his
bloody
fist
into
his
mouth
and
stabs
the
wound.
The
spectacle
of
tearing
the
edge
of
the
mouth
piercing
the
front
teeth
into
the
back
of
the
hand
and
injuring
the
skin
and
muscles
is
so
disastrous
as
to
look
away.
Just
telling
him
to
endure
with
the
mental
strength
of
steel
<@203488399061942272>
dressed
up
as
a
plain
face
So
should
I
accompany
you?
I
dont
know
what
it
is
but
Bishop.
Are
you
going
to
accompany
me!
Ah!
Ohh!
What
a
hell
a
hell
a
hell...
a
hellish
death!
Its
too
much
fun
just
to
say
go
together
The
spilled
bitter
smile
is
genuine.
However
in
response
to
<@203488399061942272>s
positive
response
Petergius
nodded
again
and
again
so
that
his
neck
was
likely
to
stiffen
and
with
his
legs
switched
he
turned
his
back
and
turned
his
back.
Immediately
the
death!
Immediately
after
I
instructed
my
fingertips
along
the
way...
I
joined
each
other
and
went
to
the
Mazars
territory.
There
Death
follows
the
guidance
of
the
Gospel!
Okay..
By
the
way
what
are
you
trying
to
do?
Naturally
questionable
death.
Test
whether
it
is
suitable
for
a
witchs
vessel...
That
is
the
strength
that
the
container
holds
the
witchs
soul
the
quality
is
more
qualified
than
anything
else
try
death!
<@203488399061942272>
nodded
with
an
unmistakable
look
to
the
less
specific
explanation.
I
dont
know
the
details.
But
thats
far
better
than
the
annoying
time
that
Satella-Emilia
didnt
understand.
And
this
time
around
I
can
get
back
to
Emilia
again.
However
for
that
reason-
-
Come
on
come
on!
Come
on!
Come
on!
Death
to
try!
If
the
equipment
of
this
time
is
not
suitable
the
witch
will
return
to
the
world
again
Death!
This
is
the
first
time
in
hundreds
of
years
Take
this
opportunity
to
fill
all
the
seats!
When
the
witch
Satella
comes
down
the
child
of
the
vessel...
Death
is
a
sacrificial
sacrifice!
Death
is
an
honorable
death!
I
would
like
to
replace
it
if
I
could
replace
it.
If
I
were
to
hold
this
body
and
fit
Satellas
will
I
would
repeat
it
again
and
again.
Endure
the
pain
and
hope
for
a
reunion
from
Death!
Yes
disappear?
<@203488399061942272>
muttered
small
following
behind
Peterghius
who
started
walking
with
madness.
It
was
a
whisper
that
couldnt
reach
Petergeus
who
stayed
in
his
own
world
and
continued
to
laugh.
Hey
right?
--The
madman
didnt
even
notice
that
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>
laughed
horribly
miserably.
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
Push
the
sword
into
the
center
of
the
thin
body
and
twist
it.
The
response
coming
from
the
tip
of
the
sword
has
taught
us
the
sense
of
tearing
away
the
important
things
of
life.
A
trembling
sigh
leaked
into
the
emptiness
I
wouldnt
believe
you
even
say
this.
why……
I
was
the
least
of
the
guys
I
hate
about
Peter.
Astonishingly
pressed
his
eyes
desperately
looked
down
at
the
black
eyes
that
were
crossing
in
the
immediate
vicinity.
The
sword
comes
out
of
the
body
which
slowly
falls
backwards
with
an
indelible
surprise.
At
that
moment
<@203488399061942272>
stepped
down
and
took
a
deep
breath.
Below
that
is
Petergius
Romanée-Conti
who
falls
into
a
blood
pool.
The
heart
is
destroyed
directly
by
<@203488399061942272>s
hand
and
Petergeus
who
is
still
dead.
So
far
Ive
had
a
hard
time
making
a
situation.
Youre
a
bit
too
smart
pretending
to
be
crazy.
Honestly
Ive
been
holding
my
head
so
many
times.
What
are
you
saying...
whats
the
death...?
I
talked
about
how
much
trial
and
error
it
took
to
get
here.
No
the
strategy
was
the
same
but
the
trump
cards
were
really
dangerous.
Seriously
relieved.
Petergius
crawls
with
force
into
his
weak
limbs.
However
there
is
no
room
to
stand
up
and
fight
back.
Just
crawl
backwards
away
from
death.
And
without
doing
anything
the
life
of
Petergius
is
not
long.
At
first
I
couldnt
see
the
invisible
hand
and
I
was
impatient
because
of
what
I
was
doing.
I
was
also
troubled
by
the
fingertips...
Now
I
am
satisfied
with
the
accomplishment
I
was
able
to
manage.
Gu
u
uu...
The
flowing
blood
is
the
remaining
life
of
Petersius.
Instead
of
stopping
the
bleeding
<@203488399061942272>
begins
to
see
the
blood
flowing
without
losing
momentum
and
reveals
the
seeds
in
a
black
curtain.
An
invisible
hand
that
manipulates
the
invisible
black
palm.
The
fingertip
which
is
the
reserve
of
the
physical
body
on
the
contrary
the
heart
of
Petersius.
Then
possessed
that
prolongs
life
by
transferring
to
the
spare
body.
Using
these
things
Petergeus
tries
to
hunt
down
Emilia
by
his
own
hardworking
behavior
and
it
was
really
painful
to
defeat
it.
It
would
take
over
400
trials
and
errors
to
get
to
this
point.
So
definitely
youre
the
one
in
the
world
that
talks
to
you
the
most.
Its
a
selfish
story
but
I
feel
like
friendship.
Im
dedicated
to
my
goals
and
I
use
all
the
cards
I
have.
Im
not
impressed
with
the
attitude
of
trying
to
fight
through.
What
what
what
what
what
what
what!
At
the
end
of
the
body
a
force
similar
to
anger
dwelled
in
the
body
that
just
fell
toward
death.
All
of
it
is
poured
into
ones
own
existence
and
the
body
Peterzius
wakes
up.
Vomiting
blood-literally
spilling
blood
from
its
mouth
Petergius
with
his
bloody
eyes
wide
open
turns
to
<@203488399061942272>
Betrayal!
A
traitor
who
disobeys
the
witchs
darling!
Forgive
me
forgive
me
death!
Screaming
Petergius
extended
his
bloody
arm.
It
is
not
an
action
to
activate
the
invisible
hand.
There
is
no
meaning
to
the
invisible
arm
being
cut
off.
Here
there
is
only
one
way
for
Petergius
to
entangle.
The
conditions
for
the
evil
spirit
Petergeus
Romanée-Conti
to
deprive
the
body.
The
process
of
possessing
the
human
body
the
human
being
who
has
the
ability
as
a
spiritist.
And
there
is
only
one
person
who
has
the
qualification
in
this
place-
Your
body--!
<@203488399061942272>
exhaled
a
small
sigh
to
Petergeus
who
was
willing
to
take
it
away.
Then
he
slowly
stepped
forward
and
kicked
off
with
the
appearance
of
the
death
of
Petersius.
The
front
teeth
were
blown
away
by
the
front
kick
which
was
struck
in
with
all
his
might.
I
couldnt
transfer
to
the
body
that
should
be
robbed.
<@203488399061942272>
proves
the
answer
not
the
words
with
his
left
hand-the
faint
red
glow
emerging
from
his
fingertips.
It
is
an
entity
called
a
fine
spirit.
A
cute
tool
that
has
the
role
of
illuminating
the
dark
road
by
concluding
a
contract
with
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>
who
has
the
spirit
of
a
spiritist.
The
evil
spirit
Petergeuss
Possession
can
only
be
transferred
to
the
body
of
an
uncontracted
spiritist.
How
many
deaths
did
it
take
to
determine
this
condition?
Its
been
the
longest
three
days
of
my
life.
You
probably
had
a
very
short
relationship...
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>uuuu!!
I
aimed
at
Emilia.-Long
regret
should
be
long.
Petergius
screams
in
hatred
kicking
his
chest
down
and
swinging
his
sword
down
on
his
face
on
his
back.
Relentlessly
the
sword
attacked
Petergius
skull
destroying
his
entire
brain.
Suddenly
the
annoying
ending
magic
breaks
and
<@203488399061942272>
exhales
long
while
entrusting
his
weight
to
a
sword
that
pierces
Petergius
and
pierces
the
ground.
The
fierce
battle
with
Petersius
which
was
short
in
real
time
and
too
long
in
experience
time
ended.
Both
a
sense
of
accomplishment
and
a
sense
of
collapse
come
in.
Oh?
It
looks
like
this
was
over
too.
Then
<@203488399061942272>
who
was
immersed
in
the
silence
for
a
while
asked.
When
I
turned
around
it
was
about
to
scrape
through
the
lush
trees
and
make
huge
shadows-a
black
beast
a
monster
with
ferocious
limbs
on
the
head
of
a
lion
came
to
me
with
a
humor.
Of
course
it
is
not
the
beast
that
has
called
out
in
a
dull
tone.
A
girl
who
straddles
her
back
and
sends
a
non-age-matching
eye
to
<@203488399061942272>.
Oh
Im
done.
It
was
saved
Mary.
Its
okay.
I
got
a
reward
and
Elsa
also
helped
my
brother.
But
was
it
okay?
They
were
fellow
brothers
didnt
they?
I
dont
know.
If
I
didnt
try
to
kill
it
at
the
end
I
could
say
I
was
a
friend
who
was
a
long
time
ago
but
I
was
trying
to
kill
me.
Unfortunately
Im
a
failure
of
my
friend
right?
He
wipes
the
blood
that
splashes
on
his
cheeks
with
his
sleeve
and
<@203488399061942272>
shrugs
his
shoulders
on
a
girl
–
Mary.
Then
Mary
puts
her
finger
on
her
chin
Hmm.
Then
because
I
dont
try
to
kill
your
brother
whats
your
brothers
friend?
Thats
the
reason.
Thats
right.
You
and
I
are
friends
Mary.
Wow
I
did
it.
With
this
I
want
to
be
friends
with
Petra-chan
and
friends.
With
both
hands
together
Mary
shook
her
shoulders
happily
on
the
back
of
the
beast.
Raising
his
childish
attitude
<@203488399061942272>
was
surprised
to
find
her
friend
in
her
mouth.
Wow
thats
surprising.
Im
sure
youve
had
friends
with
me
like
this.
Yeah.
Ive
killed
myself
but
I
dont
know.
「――――」
With
a
thin
smile
Mary
said
with
no
guilt
about
it.
Did
the
killing
mean
that
he
was
involved
in
the
work?
At
one
point
I
thought
that
there
was
something
childish
in
Maily
but
ethics
was
still
twisted.
Well
it
was
because
it
was
a
sister
of
Elsa.
In
any
case
it
was
saved
because
Mailly
made
up
for
the
lack
of
work.
Otherwise
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
kill
all
the
fingertips
that
were
hiding
here
and
there.
Its
okay
but
I
wonder
if
it
wasnt
for
us
to
do
it?
I
wish
I
could
have
asked
for
a
knight
from
a
more
sloppy
country.
That
didnt
meet
all
my
goals.
Purpose?
Mailly
leans
and
tries
to
find
<@203488399061942272>s
ideas.
However
<@203488399061942272>
does
not
intend
to
explain
further
and
when
he
makes
a
suitable
smile
From
now
on
its
an
adult
story.
You
dont
have
to
know
children
like
Mary.
Ah!
Ill
treat
you
like
that
anymore!
Ah!
I
dont
know
I
dont
know!
When
Punksuka
and
Mary
are
angry
the
monster
roars
as
if
inspired
by
the
anger.
Inadvertently
you
shouldnt
be
struck
by
a
beast
here.
I
dont
want
to
end
this
lap
with
a
failure
because
I
struggled
to
kill
Petergius.
Somehow
<@203488399061942272>
struggled
all
the
way
to
recover
Marys
slanted
mood
and
worked
to
mitigate
the
girls
mood.
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
Within
a
few
days
from
the
start
of
the
election
the
prints
of
the
Kingdom
of
Lugnica
have
changed
considerably.
To
begin
with
the
biggest
change
is
the
dropout
of
the
Duke
of
Krusz
Karsten
who
was
considered
the
most
promising
candidate
for
the
king-although
only
<@203488399061942272>
understands
the
facts.
This
is
because
the
existence
of
this
person
named
Kursh
disappeared
from
this
world
without
a
trace
and
the
fact
that
it
existed
was
wiped
out
and
recorded
in
the
world
as
something
that
did
not
exist.
Therefore
the
election
was
originally
started
with
four
people
and
the
memories
of
those
who
were
supposed
to
support
the
Duke
of
Karsten
were
distorted
and
they
formed
into
different
powers.
The
mist
of
a
white
whale
is
crazy.
It
would
erase
the
records
of
others.
It
is
a
mystery
why
it
doesnt
work
only
for
<@203488399061942272>.
However
since
I
didnt
remember
doing
anything
special
to
<@203488399061942272>
himself
it
was
troublesome
to
have
strange
conflicts
with
other
peoples
conversations.
Forget
about
the
lost
Krush
Karsten.
Recklessly
there
is
no
chance
of
recovery
for
the
human
who
died
as
a
result
of
challenging
a
powerful
enemy
beyond
his
power.
Only
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>
can
get
the
opportunity.
Therefore
remember
the
losers
as
foolishness
that
should
not
be
imitated.
There
are
other
changes
than
those
that
have
no
meaning
other
than
<@203488399061942272>.
that
is--
Emilia
one
of
the
candidates
for
the
royal
election.
Subjugates
the
witchs
deadly
sin
bishop
laziness
who
has
suffered
the
world
for
many
years...!
I
hear
that
the
kingdom
has
boiled
and
the
achievements
have
spread
to
other
countries.
As
a
subaru
it
had
a
surprising
advertising
effect.It
transferred
the
victory
that
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>
accumulated
after
400
deaths
to
Emilia
who
was
handed
over
to
a
dubious
clown
to
help
her.
It
was
the
result.
Honestly
the
negotiation
to
give
merit
to
Emilia
and
the
attitude
that
a
man
who
is
considered
a
frontier
respond
to
it
was
a
bet
comparable
to
the
subjugation
of
Petersius
Because
he
was
a
sick
person
who
could
understand
the
story.
After
receiving
the
offer
of
<@203488399061942272>
the
remote
count
Roswar
L.
Mathers
immediately
accepted
the
offer
and
immediately
announced
the
achievements
of
the
subjugation
of
Petersius
as
Emilias.
<@203488399061942272>
is
not
reluctant
to
Roswars
actions
though
he
remembers
his
attitude.
Originally
Emilia
was
in
a
position
to
be
disdained
for
silly
reasons
in
this
world.
She
made
her
name
as
a
supporter
of
her
and
became
a
backing
to
promote
participation
in
the
election.
Maybe
there
is
a
horrible
expectation
that
if
Emilia
takes
the
throne
in
the
chance
she
will
be
able
to
sip
sweet
juice.
It
is
a
good
proof
that
he
dripped
his
saliva
and
jumped
at
the
report
of
the
subjugation
of
Petergius.
Its
okay.
You
like
it
Mr.
Frontier.
As
long
as
youre
on
Emilias
side
Ill
be
on
your
side.
As
youd
expect
Emilia
will
be
the
king.
To
that
end
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>
will
do
his
best
to
overcome
this
death.
But
if
Roswar
had
an
unreasonable
hope
or
disproportionate
idea
for
Emilia
then--
Its
just
about
adding
one
more
grave
marker
for
Emilia.
Until
then
at
best
in
order
to
continue
to
leap
forward
in
a
position
unknown
to
Emilia
Roswar
has
no
choice
but
to
leave
his
open
action.
Instead
under
the
hood
<@203488399061942272>
goes
about
all
his
schemes.
To
do
that--
I
picked
it
up.
Im
in
trouble
if
it
doesnt
help
Ao.
「――――」
At
the
back
of
the
cave
there
is
a
prison
with
an
iron
fence
of
apologies.
In
that
cold
space
the
person
who
is
tied
up
in
a
chain
is
a
man
in
a
dirty
appearance.
A
girl
with
flaxen
cat
ears
on
her
head
and
a
delicate
body
wrapped
in
the
white
uniform
of
a
Konguard
knight-the
wind
manly.
It
was
a
tool
that
<@203488399061942272>
found
and
took
home
as
a
loot
while
he
was
rushing
to
clean
up
after
the
death
of
Petergius
and
the
wreckage
of
the
white
whale.
However
I
have
not
been
fortunate
enough
to
have
the
opportunity
to
show
the
genius
of
the
healing
technique
called
blue
which
is
rumored
to
hear.
On
the
contrary
he
doesnt
heal
his
wounds
hes
just
staring
at
the
prison
floor
and
muttering
sobbing.
...Tell
me
tell
me.
What
am
I
doing...
What
are
you
doing
for
me?
What
am
I
doing?
There
was
someone.
I
suppose
it
was.
But
Im
here.
This
is
going
to
take
some
time.
Scratching
his
head
<@203488399061942272>
takes
out
the
letter
in
his
pocket.
It
is
a
sticker
that
can
be
used
to
inform
the
start
of
the
election
process
and
is
something
that
<@203488399061942272>
will
carry
around
with
care
of
his
posterity.
The
contents
of
the
poster
have
changed
from
what
<@203488399061942272>
knows.
Five
candidates
should
have
been
lined
up
but
the
personalization
is
now
four
and
the
description
is
reduced.
Did
the
change
apply
to
Kursch
Karstens
disappearance?
But
I
remember
<@203488399061942272>s
memory.
Even
though
it
wasnt
in
my
eyes
I
read
this
article
back
to
the
point
where
it
punctured.
The
name
of
the
knight
of
Krush
Karsten
is
Felix
Argyle.
He
must
have
been
the
blue
healer
in
front
of
me.
When
I
was
erased
by
the
mist
of
a
white
whale
it
was
my
assumption
that
my
memory
would
respond
to
changes
so
that
I
wouldnt
feel
discomfort.
Tell
me
who
you
are...
Your
Highness
Your
Highness?
Your
Highness
with
whom...?
If
its
big
enough
to
make
up
for
the
missing
memory
will
it
look
like
this?
If
the
existence
that
had
a
great
influence
on
the
personality
formation
of
the
human
being
and
it
falls
out
of
the
world
the
human
being
itself
will
not
be
established
as
a
matter
of
course.
Therefore
the
blue
that
repeats
like
a
broken
doll
has
become
like
this.
Unfortunately
<@203488399061942272>
does
not
know
how
to
heal
a
broken
heart.
There
was
no
connection
between
<@203488399061942272>
and
the
only
being
who
could
protect
his
heart.
Even
if
we
try
again
<@203488399061942272>
does
not
set
the
time
to
go
back.
So
<@203488399061942272>
doesnt
know
what
story
was
between
him
and
her.
Its
still
the
piece
I
found.
Its
okay.
Ill
surely
fill
in
the
cracks
in
your
heart.
Someone
please
tell
me.
Why
am
I...?
Blue
does
not
show
any
reaction
to
<@203488399061942272>s
words.
It
seems
that
the
roar
is
not
clear
but
<@203488399061942272>
is
not
impatient
and
is
prepared
to
face
each
other
over
time.
There
is
no
such
thing
as
the
power
to
heal
wounds
the
knight
who
has
lost
the
leaning
edge
and
the
piece
that
is
so
easy
to
handle.
Thats
why
<@203488399061942272>
is
sincere
and
sincere
This
time
Ill
find
a
way
to
prevent
you
from
committing
suicide.
As
many
times
as
I
faced
my
willingness
to
die
he
declared
that.
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
All
the
doorways
of
the
mansion
were
closed.
Hit
the
door
from
the
inside
and
put
all
the
boards
on
the
windows.
You
may
have
noticed
the
situation
in
the
dark
mansion
with
the
curtains
closed
if
you
had
the
caution
to
ask
that
it
was
strange.
Of
course
I
was
convinced
that
such
a
thing
wouldnt
happen
but
I
set
about
this
time.
--!
A
terrible
business
fire
completely
encloses
the
huge
mansion
and
burns
it.
Not
knowing
that
the
flames
spread
around
the
mansion
as
fire
sources
would
not
stop
the
building
burned
up
with
no
momentum
to
extinguish
the
fire
and
everything
was
raging
in
the
ashes.
A
mansion
surrounded
by
flames
where
it
is
not
only
the
household
items
and
accessories
that
are
charred.
Many
women
who
have
spent
a
lot
of
time
and
pain
in
this
mansion
also
lose
their
lives
in
the
flames
and
smoke
and
turn
into
charcoal
that
they
may
not
have
been
human.
Too
terrible
business
even
if
it
seems
that
it
is
savagery.
But
who
would
believe
that
this
was
none
other
than
what
women
who
were
about
to
burn
to
death
wanted?
Play
play
do
not
play!
A
mans
abusive
voice
echoes
in
the
mansion
where
the
fire
is
strong
and
the
heat
of
the
wind
increases.
Its
a
pitiful
silent
voice
in
a
building
thats
burned
and
collapsed.
The
voice
crazy
about
what
happened
if
he
could
not
believe
this
situation
No.
92!
No.
114!
No.
123!
No
matter
where!?
Where
did
you
go?
Who
do
you
think
I
am?
To
leave
me
alone
and
die
in
this
situation
To
what
extent
are
you
irresponsible
and
selfish!?
It
was
a
white-haired
young
man
who
shouted
in
a
flipped
voice
like
a
child
with
tantrums.
Dressed
in
a
white
robe
the
mediocre
features
look
like
demons
and
scatter.
Its
too
abnormal
in
a
mansion
fire
that
could
collapse.
A
normal
person
should
take
every
possible
step
to
escape
this
fire.
However
this
man
does
not
show
the
behavior.
On
the
contrary
he
is
acting
based
on
an
ethic
that
transcends
life
and
death
where
he
never
thinks
he
will
die.
The
mans
head
is
crazy
but
not
necessarily.
-No
it
is
not
accurate
to
deny
it
but
the
man
has
a
certain
conviction.
I
cant
die
myself
in
this
fire.
Therefore
the
reason
a
man
is
yelling
is
totally
unrelated
to
his
fear
of
death.
All
in
all
its
an
irresistible
anger
towards
my
wife
who
might
have
caused
this
suspicious
fire.
The
situation
was
so
angry
that
I
couldnt
see
my
feet
Every
time
despise
my
limited
assets-
-I
wish
I
could
close
my
mouth
which
I
cant
listen
to.
Na
The
angry
mans
face
is
directly
hit
by
the
sole
of
the
shoe
that
pierces
through
the
flame
wall.
A
sudden
blow
from
an
unexpected
angle
and
an
unexpected
shock
caused
the
mans
body
to
go
to
the
other
side
of
the
corridor.
The
wall
there
was
also
brittle
with
flames
and
could
not
stand
the
mans
collision
and
collapsed.
The
man
was
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
burning
violently
and
rolling
into
a
large
letter.
Nah...
This
flame
is
a
sign
of
the
insulation
from
many
of
your
wives.
To
put
it
physically
it
seems
that
the
fear-bound
love
is
over.
The
voice
of
the
stunned
man
responded
to
the
voice
heard
at
the
same
time
as
the
kick.
When
the
man
raised
his
body
as
if
he
was
hit
he
overcame
the
crushed
wall
and
a
woman
in
a
jet-black
costume
was
about
to
enter
the
burning
room.
It
has
a
distinct
smile
and
long
braid
with
long
black
hair.
However
above
all
it
is
the
curved
blade
held
in
his
right
hand
that
speaks
clearly
of
the
womans
position.
A
bandit!
Who
do
you
think
I
am?
I
regret
that
I
made
a
fool
of
myself...
The
man
tried
to
attack
the
woman
by
wailing
and
swinging
his
arms
up.
However
his
intention
was
frustrated
by
a
light
impact
and
the
fact
that
his
arms
cut
off
by
his
elbows
were
seen
at
the
edges
of
his
field
of
vision.
I
lowered
my
line
of
sight
and
saw
the
sight
of
my
arm
disappearing.
can
not
understand.
What
on
earth
is
this
going
on?
Immortal?
Invincible?
Ive
forgotten
either
but
its
said
that
the
seed
has
been
revealed.
Youre
just
like
an
unpleasant
insect.
-Huh!
Youre
a
whore-
「――――」
Forgetting
the
loss
of
both
arms
a
man
whose
pride
has
been
injured
tries
to
taunt
a
woman
with
dirty
words.
However
the
woman
doesnt
let
you
say
all
that.
He
lifted
up
his
long
legs
and
kicked
up
the
crotch
of
a
man
in
a
posture
where
he
had
a
mochi
on
the
ground.
A
mans
body
emerges
from
the
power
and
the
womans
blade
which
is
held
by
both
arms
draws
death.
Both
arms
are
further
amputated
above
the
elbows
and
at
the
shoulders
and
the
legs
are
sliced
u200bu200bin
a
gradual
fashion
from
the
toes
to
the
thighs.
A
slashing
attack
entered
the
toes
ankles
shins
knees
and
thighs
and
the
mans
body
rapidly
changed
into
a
state
of
sight
while
seeing
blood.
--
Me
Even
in
that
state
its
still
good
to
say
something.
A
womans
direct
kick
stabbed
into
the
much
smaller
target
crushing
a
window
that
would
have
been
closed
with
a
board
blowing
the
mans
body
out
of
the
burning
mansion.
A
man
without
a
limb
falls
to
the
ground
without
being
passive
along
with
broken
pieces
of
window
glass.
Fortunately
the
room
was
on
the
second
floor
and
the
fall
prevented
the
catastrophic
damage.
However
the
current
situation
of
losing
limbs
and
causing
massive
bleeding
is
already
fatal.
I
wonder
if
such
a
silly
thing
would
happen...
Im
the
most
completed
person
in
the
world.
I
didnt
ask
for
much
I
knew
it
was
enough
and
I
lived
unselfishly
in
poverty...
So
why
should
I
be
such
a
defective
person
like
you
guys...
If
thats
the
only
bad
thing
I
usually
do
Im
sure
Im
brought
into
divorce
mediation.
What!?
Another
man
is
reflected
in
his
field
of
view
a
man
who
is
no
longer
able
to
turn
over
by
himself.
Whoever
is
black-eyed
black-eyed
boy
in
a
black
robe-Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>.
<@203488399061942272>
sighs
at
the
poorly
blind
man
No
way
I
didnt
think
the
people
around
here
would
cooperate
Regulus
said.
Why
are
you
here...
no
what
did
you
do...?
What
else
do
you
have?
A
man
who
shrugged
and
finally
understood
the
situation-<@203488399061942272>
distorted
his
cheeks
with
Regulus.
Looked
down
at
by
the
smile
Regulus
was
angry
in
his
eyes
Curry
sir
this
Guess
guy!
Do
you
know
what
you
did?!
My
beloved
wife
my
wives!
I
burned
and
killed
my
mansion
in
front
of
me!
How
outrageous
Do
you
know
if
it
was
a
devilish
deed!?
Its
an
unexpected
cut
and
I
cant
block
the
open
mouth.
Im
telling
you
its
the
wife
who
was
the
only
one
who
gave
your
life
to
prevent
your
heart.
「――Idiot
Regulus
screams
at
<@203488399061942272>
who
picks
his
ears
and
tells
him
with
an
amazed
face.
It
is
harder
for
<@203488399061942272>
to
understand
the
reaction
which
is
truly
unbearable.
Regulus
encircled
many
women
in
his
mansion
in
the
name
of
his
wife
and
threatened
with
violence
if
he
opposed
them
and
killed
them
enjoying
a
selfish
marriage.
If
that
were
the
case
it
would
seem
like
a
terrible
evil
desire
for
Harlem
but
the
ugliness
of
his
Bishop
of
the
Deadly
Sins
does
not
stop
there.
He
was
a
villain
who
realized
his
immortality
and
invincibility
by
keeping
his
heart
in
his
wives
and
stopping
the
time
of
his
own
body.
The
deadly
bishop
greed
the
only
way
to
kill
Regulus
Cornias
is
to
return
his
heart
to
him.
The
only
way
to
do
that
was
to
kill
all
the
wives
he
had
entrusted
with
his
heart
and
lose
his
place
to
hide
his
heart.
<@203488399061942272>
also
struggled
with
the
decision
when
he
came
across
this
fact.
However
it
was
the
wives
who
were
captive
by
none
other
than
Regulus-no
women
who
solved
this
<@203488399061942272>s
hesitation.
Everyone
its
okay
to
die
if
you
give
me
an
arrow.
I
cant
remember
hearing
that
even
if
Im
told
to
hide
up
to
that
point.
“Who
do
you
believe
in...
I
loved
my
wives!
So
they
should
love
me!
Why
why
do
I
look
like
this?
...I
mean
Im
telling
you.
Im
really
afraid
of
that
you
guys.
<@203488399061942272>
murmured
with
a
reluctant
face
turning
his
eyes
from
Regulus
who
was
still
abusive
and
misleading.
At
the
end
of
the
line
of
sight
I
jumped
down
from
the
burning
mansion
and
landed
in
the
garden
a
black
shadow-Erza.
She
gently
wiped
the
soot
off
her
body
and
noticed
<@203488399061942272>s
gaze
Ah
are
you
worried?
Rest
assured.
Im
not
hurt
anywhere.
Dont
worry.
What
else
is
this?
Dont
tell
me
if
its
such
a
bad
taste.
<@203488399061942272>
bent
his
lips
and
pointed
to
Regulus
who
had
no
limbs.
At
least
it
was
Elsa
who
brought
it
into
this
state
because
there
was
a
limb
in
the
Regulus
that
<@203488399061942272>
had
seen.
She
shrugged
at
the
point
It
seemed
noisy
if
I
had
limbs
and
I
think
it
would
have
been
better
if
I
could
convey
the
words
from
those
people.
...Thats
right.
Surprisingly
it
seems
that
Elsa
had
a
heart
to
care
for
others.
Women
who
were
victims
of
Regulus
it
is
wrong
to
let
them
die
without
telling
them
how
they
prepared
to
trap
Regulus
in
this
way.
And
more
than
I
told
it--
Giaaa!
Elsa
pierces
Reguluss
chest
with
a
Kukuri
knife
and
slowly
lifts
her
body
which
has
become
much
lighter.
Regulus
was
struggling
with
blood
and
struggling
as
if
it
were
a
skewered
ingredient
earnestly
craving
for
life.
At
a
glance?
Disagreeable……
<@203488399061942272>
puts
his
hand
on
his
chin
and
thinks
about
Elsas
question.
Although
not
Elsa
<@203488399061942272>
has
the
same
feelings
of
compassion
and
indignation.
And
that
heart
appeals
to
those
women
who
hope
for
death
in
tears.
So
<@203488399061942272>
ordered
Elsa.
Throw
it
into
a
low
heat.
Watch
it
die.
Yes
I
understand.
Elsa
nodded
with
a
grudge
against
<@203488399061942272>s
cruel
instructions.
Then
I
threw
a
body
of
Regulus
who
could
not
stop
resenting
into
the
end
of
a
burning
mansion
a
pile
of
scrap
wood
that
was
slightly
burned.
「――――」
A
scream
of
a
man
who
burns
himself
and
continues
to
be
burned
by
flames
until
the
end
of
his
death
lingers
in
the
night
sky.
<@203488399061942272>
continued
to
watch
Elsa
side
by
side
without
changing
her
complexion.
Insects
are
more
comfortable
to
squeal
so
its
better
than
that.
Elsa
spilled
over
when
a
long
and
long
death
day
stopped.
It
was
the
same
with
<@203488399061942272>.
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
--The
sound
of
the
broken
glass
sounded
to
<@203488399061942272>
as
the
sound
of
trust
shattering.
This
is...
Im
sorry.
Really
sorry.
I
didnt
want
to
do
this.
Really
its
true.
In
a
startling
trembling
voice
the
man
slammed
his
elbow
on
the
counter.
However
without
being
able
to
support
the
collapsing
body
the
upper
body
slips
and
the
chair
that
he
was
sitting
on
is
knocked
down
to
the
floor
of
the
store.
When
the
glass
and
bottle
on
the
counter
fell
into
the
floor
and
broke
the
contents
of
the
splattered
soiled
the
mans
white
uniform.
Freedom
of
the
limbs
does
not
work
and
the
blood
gradually
fades.
The
man
was
blinking
many
times
in
the
sense
that
his
lips
became
bluish-purple
and
his
field
of
vision
became
dull
and
he
was
trying
to
keep
away
from
the
impending
end.
<@203488399061942272>
sits
at
a
table
and
looks
down
at
the
mans
hard
scratching.
A
man
with
an
elegant
look.
He
was
slender
and
tall
and
was
full
of
dignity
when
he
entered
the
store
and
the
language
used
for
his
friends.
Just
like
a
knight.
Im
sure
its
called
the
best
Julius
Euclius.
Ki-sama
is...
But
if
you
can
control
your
position
you
should
pay
more
attention
to
your
surroundings.
Its
the
position
of
the
knight
candidate
the
first
knight
who
flutters
now.
Naturally
not
only
the
master
but
myself.
I
have
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
I
am
targeted.
A
man
who
suffers
painfully-Subscribes
to
Julius
and
stands
up
<@203488399061942272>
stretches
his
arms.
His
arm
turned
to
the
person
sitting
in
the
chair
next
to
the
falling
Julius.
With
a
lovely
flax-colored
cat
ears
gently
pulling
her
delicate
shoulders
and
stroking
her
head.
With
that
alone
Blue
seemed
to
be
confused
and
lowered
its
quality.
Fee
lis...
you
are...
I
was
having
a
hard
time
getting
into
my
heart.
I
didnt
think
I
would
end
up
doing
it
for
the
life
of
someone
other
than
that.
It
was
worth
it.
What
are
you
planning...
It
doesnt
matter
to
you
anymore.
Rest
assured.
In
my
opinion
if
you
fall
you
shouldnt
have
to
harm
your
master.
I
dont
know
if
you
get
upset.
Juliuss
yellow
twins
are
confused
with
confusion
and
anger
sadness
and
confusion
grief
and
doubts.
But
all
that
fast-changing
emotions
are
meaningless.
This
is
the
moment
I
was
called
by
my
old
friend
and
had
a
drink
at
the
bar.
Trust
is
a
sweet
poison
Mr.
Sai.
I
drowned
at
it
and
made
a
mistake.
...Oh
ku
Its
easy
to
do
something
that
anyone
can
be
proud
of.
Its
easy
to
live
and
envy.
Ill
die.
He
crouches
down
and
looks
into
the
face
of
Julius
who
is
dimly
conscious.
Already
Juliuss
line
of
sight
has
not
seen
<@203488399061942272>.
Im
not
stuck
with
a
man
who
ordered
me
to
kill
myself.
However
staying
in
his
twins
is
the
safety
of
a
friend
who
was
used
for
an
undesired
assault
and
perhaps
a
remorse
for
the
Lord
who
is
not
here--
「――――」
Im
a
knight
forever.
I
wish
I
didnt
hate
you.
<@203488399061942272>
exhaled
looking
down
at
his
face
as
he
died
in
eternal
silence.
The
reason
why
my
chest
is
so
disappointing
is
that
there
was
probably
no
reason
to
die
for
this
best
knight.
<@203488399061942272>
commanded
a
deadly
killing
the
closer
he
was
to
the
first
time.
There
is
no
pain
in
dying
those
who
are
involved
in
witchcraft
and
the
deadly
sin.
However
in
this
killing
<@203488399061942272>
simply
selected
which
one
was
easier
to
blame.
It
is
less
vigilant
than
the
candidate
Anastasia
Hoshin
who
is
always
surrounded
by
escorts
and
above
all
it
is
possible
to
use
blue
that
is
dependent
on
words
and
made
dependent.
Did
<@203488399061942272>
did
I
do
well?
Its
well
done.
It
was
bad
because
of
the
hard
work.
Watching
Julius
death
he
asks
with
a
thin
voice
of
blue
beside
<@203488399061942272>
who
has
stood
up.
That
attitude
made
<@203488399061942272>
shrug
and
shrugged
her
anxious
head
again.
If
that
alone
calms
the
emotionally
unstable
mind
I
will
stroke
it
as
many
times
as
I
want.
Okay
I
hope
it
helps
<@203488399061942272>
because
it
is
necessary
to
shape
the
future
that
His
Highness
and
<@203488399061942272>
wanted.
Oh
yes.
Thats
why
your
friends
didnt
want
to
live.
Yes……
Perhaps
with
the
emotionally
diluted
expression
the
death
of
a
friend
still
feels
like
his
heart
is
cracking.
Blue
gently
plucked
<@203488399061942272>s
hem
to
fill
the
void
of
his
heart.
Then
when
the
scent
of
death
continues
to
drift
in
the
store
--Are
you
taking
it
in?
Nobody
came
in
and
opened
an
entrance
that
shouldnt
be
there
and
one
Yuu
entered
the
store.
An
outsider
is
thinking
of
sealing
if
he
sees
a
bad
situation
but
fortunately
he
doesnt
need
sealing.
Because
it
is
a
related
person.
Its
on
time
Yes.
The
time
is
finite
and
it
is
the
merchants
idea
that
money
and
time
are
equal.
Its
quite
a
thick
face
that
I
can
still
call
myself
a
merchant.
Its
a
death
merchant.
What
is
it
saying?
<@203488399061942272>s
words
scratched
his
head
a
slender
man
with
gray
hair.
The
slender
body
wrapped
in
a
black
suit
and
tightened
up
to
a
black
tie
is
at
first
glance
a
mediocre
mans
funeral
home
or
something
but
if
you
look
closely
youll
find
an
unfathomable
dead
odor
all
over
his
body.
His
face
is
gentle
and
his
eyes
are
gentle
but
there
are
apparently
some
cautions
regarding
how
to
look
around
him
which
suggests
that
he
was
diving
through
the
shrine.
Above
all
I
like
the
cloudy
eyes.
Its
the
eyes
of
a
living
corpse
who
have
lost
the
worth
of
life
lost
the
meaning
of
living
and
still
chose
to
live.
The
eyes
next
to
me
which
are
close
to
blue
in
nature.
I
didnt
hear
your
name...
I
have
never
named
myself
and
I
do
not
intend
to
name
myself.
Of
course
I
do
not
want
to
ask
for
your
name.
That
person
can
be
relieved
from
each
other.
Well
youre
right.
You
cant
be
friends.
Yes.
If
there
is
something
I
will
immediately
turn
to
the
enemy.
Is
this
the
result
of
calling
such
an
opponent
a
friend?
A
man
screams
at
the
corpse
of
Julius
who
lay
down
on
the
ground
and
the
blue
snuggled
up
to
<@203488399061942272>.
Without
saying
anything
ironically
<@203488399061942272>
turned
to
the
exit
of
the
store.
It
was
secretly
prepared
in
cooperation
with
the
man
to
arrange
and
clean
up
the
poison.
If
you
move
the
witch
religion
it
will
be
troublesome.
<@203488399061942272>
is
now
on
a
tightrope.
Please
give
my
best
regards
to
Russell.
Ask
me
again.
Right
arm?
That
persons
right
arm
is
on
his
right
shoulder.
Im
just
a
slave.
Its
a
divisive
way
of
thinking
<@203488399061942272>
liked
about
the
mans
answer
both
good
and
bad.
At
the
same
time
I
was
disappointed.
If
I
could
be
friends

The
candidates
are
slashed
the
deadly
bishop
Bishop
who
tries
to
be
blocked
is
slashed
and
the
dark
steps
for
it
are
repeated.
A
mysterious
group
a
cave
of
dangerous
people
and
on
top
of
that
they
do
not
excessively
interfere
with
each
other.
This
group
of
witchcraft
was
a
very
convenient
hideaway
for
<@203488399061942272>.
Although
it
is
a
hidden
cover
that
must
be
eradicated
at
all
times
if
it
is
used
under
such
preconditions
it
will
not
feel
guilty
to
be
disposable
enough
to
be
fresh.
The
Bishop
of
Deadly
Sins
has
no
sense
of
companionship.
Always
try
to
find
a
way
to
kill
it
try
it
and
if
it
seems
feasible
do
rooting.
Each
time
he
made
a
mistake
<@203488399061942272>
had
the
power
to
redo
the
world.
Somehow
even
in
this
situation
<@203488399061942272>
has
a
relationship
that
can
be
called
a
companion.
I
know
that
even
a
witch
etc.
cant
count
on
and
we
should
not
increase
the
number
of
people
involved.
Isnt
he
always
coming
from
the
beginning?
Im
happy
that
he
can
help
me
with
more
fun
things
in
this
condition.
Im
not
going
to
give
you
more
but
you
still
want
to
kill
me
when
I
have
the
opportunity.
Its
kind
of
nice.
If
you
have
Mr.
<@203488399061942272>
your
dreams
will
come
true.
So
I
will
keep
up
with
you..
But
what?
When
and
where
do
you
know
your
Highness
and
Mr.
<@203488399061942272>?
Isnt
he
going
to
ask
for
dirty
work?
Its
ridiculous
to
be
a
companion.
Im
an
unfamiliar
person
who
I
and
you
and
my
family
cant
see.
Its
easier
to
die
when
you
die.
One
more
step
one
step
closer
to
the
point
where
my
wish
may
come
true.
For
that
purpose
I
can
sell
my
soul
to
the
devil.
You
the
devil.
--<@203488399061942272>
himself
does
not
think
that
he
is
acting
complimented.
Still
somehow
something
like
a
supporter
appeared
in
that
deed.
It
might
have
been
saved.
With
the
power
of
Return
to
Death
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>
hopes
to
save
Emilia
and
keeps
scratching
her
feet.
The
lonely
battle
that
I
thought
I
had
to
keep
fighting
alone.
Perhaps
it
wasnt
something
I
was
alone
with
before
I
knew
it.
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
The
royal
city
was
wrapped
in
the
fire
and
<@203488399061942272>
was
panting
in
the
squeaking
pain
of
his
whole
body
looking
up
at
the
sky.
Consciousness
is
clear.
The
sharp
pain
urged
<@203488399061942272>
to
wake
up
rather
than
lose
his
consciousness.
Everything
is
clear
what
happened
and
why
you
are
here.
「――――」
In
his
arms
<@203488399061942272>
was
holding
the
body
of
Mary
who
was
stuck.
The
girl
has
already
opened
her
blinded
eyes
and
is
gazing
at
a
scene
somewhere
outside
the
world.
I
cant
see
that
cheeky
attitude
sweet
voice
that
doesnt
match
age
or
tantrums
when
treated
like
a
child.
--Because
<@203488399061942272>
returned
to
death
and
came
back
at
this
moment.
Even
if
the
point
of
return
to
death
changes
I
have
never
returned
to
the
past
more
than
before.
The
origin
of
Return
to
Death
has
changed
to
this
point
and
her
life
can
no
longer
be
recovered
as
long
as
Subils
arm
is
holding
the
body
of
the
dead
Mary.
「――――」
Knowing
that
it
would
only
comfort
his
heart
<@203488399061942272>
softly
closed
Marys
eyelid.
I
dont
have
the
qualification
to
pray
for
the
souls
of
the
dead.
This
hand
was
too
dirty
with
blood.
It
is
the
same
for
maily.
He
did
bad
things
that
couldnt
be
obtained
such
as
his
well-being
after
death.
The
sins
are
piled
up
and
they
are
chained
to
drag
<@203488399061942272>
into
hell.
But...
It
is
not
permissible
to
give
up
just
because
of
the
death.
How
many
times
did
he
die
to
get
here?
Already
over
a
thousand
reaching
tens
of
thousands
blaspheming
every
life
trampling
and
wanting
to
fulfill
my
wishes
I
came
here.
Ive
often
broken
into
the
pain
of
death.
But
each
time
a
flame
burned
my
heart.
That
first
burning
sensation
the
touch
of
my
fingertips
made
<@203488399061942272>
reach
here.
Just
one
more
step
youve
come
to
the
place
where
the
book
reaches.
Many
at
some
cost
finally
here.
And
yet--
--Its
that
far
The
voice
came
down
to
<@203488399061942272>
from
above.
It
is
not
a
metaphorical
expression
that
the
royal
capital
is
enveloped
in
flames.
Then
as
if
he
had
taken
in
the
raging
flame
the
appearance
on
Sakagami
looked
shining
brightly.
Reinhard
Van
Astraea...
I
dont
think
I
need
to
introduce
myself.
I
dont
have
many
words
to
exchange
with
you.
Reinhardts
blue
twins
shoot
straight
through
<@203488399061942272>s
underwater
eyes.
The
light
that
dwelled
in
the
twins
was
swaying
with
passion
unlike
when
I
saw
it
a
long
time
ago.
A
man
who
wasnt
disturbed
even
if
his
opponent
was
a
murderer
against
<@203488399061942272>.
The
more
intense
it
is
the
harder
it
is
to
put
it
into
words.
You
also
had
the
ability
to
hate
people
Kensei!
Im
also
surprised.
I
didnt
think
I
had
this
feeling.
Did
you
find
yourself
new?
Happy
Birthday.
Happy
Birthday
Reinhardt
Im
sorry
today
is
not
my
birthday
but
it
will
be
your
death.
The
pretentious
wording
was
made
possible
by
a
colored
man
like
Reinhardt.
<@203488399061942272>
smiled
when
he
was
sentenced
to
death
by
his
own
words.
Even
if
I
knew
that
it
didnt
mean
anything
to
me
that
I
broke
my
messed
face
and
pulled
out
the
emotions
that
were
deep
inside
I
could
only
win
that
much.
Dont
make
me
laugh
Reinhardt!
Sword
sword!
The
sword
of
the
kingdom!
Youre
the
knight
who
protects
this
kingdom
of
Lugnica!
Whats
your
countrys
defense?
Tell
me!
「――――」
<@203488399061942272>
screams
with
his
hands
open.
In
front
of
the
main
gate
of
the
royal
castle
where
two
people
faced
each
other
the
entire
view
of
the
royal
capital
that
can
be
seen
from
there
is
all
wrapped
in
fire—no
not
only
the
royal
capital.
The
fire
is
now
raging
with
the
destruction
of
the
entire
kingdom
of
Lugnika.
No
matter
how
strong
and
strong
Knight
Reinhard
is
what
can
one
person
do.
You
cant
do
anything.
That
is
the
conclusion.
Thats
a
gift
from
me
to
you!
A
trap
I
set
to
kill
you!
To
kill
me...?
Im
thinking
how
much
Im
trying
to
kill
you!
What
on
earth
how
many
times
and
thousands
of
times!
I
think
you
challenged
me!?
「――――」
Rebarhard
confused
his
cheeks
with
a
scream
of
<@203488399061942272>
who
didnt
make
sense.
I
dont
understand
him.
No
one
knows
it
except
<@203488399061942272>.
<@203488399061942272>
has
already
made
every
trial
and
error
to
kill
Reinhardt.
He
studied
and
exhausted
a
man
named
Reinhard
van
Astrea
tried
all
the
means
he
could
think
of
tampered
with
it
and
tried
to
kill
him
with
every
possible
means.
However
whatever
the
means
Reinhard
defeated
all
of
them.
As
Natsuki
<@203488399061942272>s
Asahi
cannot
influence
his
existence
at
all.
Sacrifice
Elsa
Sacrifice
Mary
sacrifice
Blue
sacrifice
a
man
who
might
have
been
a
friend
sacrifice
a
clown
to
claim
to
be
an
accomplice
sacrifice
a
witch
and
a
Bishop
of
the
Deadly
Sins.
And
I
couldnt
kill
all
kinds
of
illegals
outrages
and
outrages.
Thats
why
<@203488399061942272>
decided
to
eliminate
the
means
of
cutting
Reinhardts
life.
Ill
kill
you
as
a
knight.
Ill
drop
a
big
name
like
Kensei
on
the
ground
stomp
on
this
foot
and
spit
dirty
sputum!
To
do
that
Thats
right!
Ah
yeah
thats
it!
I
used
all
of
the
lives
of
those
around
me
and
dropped
you
to
the
ground
for
that.
Lying
on
the
ground
Mary
was
holding
her
and
<@203488399061942272>
puts
her
finger
on
Reinhardt.
Reinhardt
who
keeps
upset
his
feelings
is
cool.
Youre
a
hero
Reinhardt.
I
cant
kill
Reinhardt.
But
I
can
kill
a
hero.
Thats
how
you
kill
Reinhardt.
「――――」
To
the
silent
Reinhardt
<@203488399061942272>
proudly
spoke
with
a
dirty
and
cracked
voice.
Ill
do
my
best
go
around
make
sacrifices
shed
blood
repeatdeath
and
finally.
Being
shielded
by
Maily
and
dying
for
life
I
was
finally
able
to
face
each
other
in
this
situation.
With
all
this
sacrifice
I
was
finally
able
to
stand
on
the
same
stage.
...Why
why?
Suddenly
the
momentum
just
before
was
blown
out
by
the
hot
wind
and
a
weak
voice
was
leaking.
Why
are
you
so
strong?
Why
are
you
so
strong
that
I
cant
reach
them
without
dying?
A
trembling
voice
mixed
with
sore
throat.
In
that
respect
Reinhardts
facial
expression
is
strengthened.
He
no
longer
knows
exactly
what
<@203488399061942272>
is
thinking.
Naturally.
Even
<@203488399061942272>
doesnt
know
